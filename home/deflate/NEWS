Release 1.0.2
=============

 * Adjust package name specifications to belatedly support ACL in its
   "modern-mode".

Release 1.0.1
=============

 * Renamed Deflate system from Deflate to deflate to support
   convenience references to system by symbol rather than string name.
   NOTE: This is an incompatible change from all prior releases, all
   references to "Deflate" in system definitions will have to be
   changed to "deflate" or :deflate or equivalents.

 * Preliminary support for ecl has been added:  Due to bugs in current
   versions of ecl (10.7.1), prior versions of Deflate do not work out
   of the box.  This version should work better, once fixnum-specialized
   arrays work again on 64bit versions of ecl in an upcoming release of
   ecl.
