# pngload

A PNG (Portable Network Graphics) image format decoder.

## Overview

pngload can be used to load images in the PNG image format, both from files on disk, or streams in
memory. This library was written out of frustration with png-read, which was the only native
Common Lisp code that supports PNG.

What makes pngload different than png-read?

### Speed

png-read is very slow. For a simple test on modern hardware, it takes png-read 0.95 [1] seconds to
load an image that takes cl-png (A CFFI wrapper for libpng) 0.028s. pngload takes 0.145s.

[1] Note that I recently applied some SBCL-specific compiler optimizations to png-read, so this
figure will be lower on at least SBCL. Still though, pngload is approximately 2.5-5x faster,
depending on the image properties.

### Cleaner code

pngload should be a lot more hackable, and have more of an educational value than png-read, even
after adding lots of type declarations and restructuring the code away from its original cleanliness
in favor of performance.

### Full support for all chunks

The entire concrete syntax tree is parsed, and is visible as a slot in the returned `PNG-OBJECT`
object when decoding an image. png-read does not support some of these. Additionally, human-readable
formats are stored outside of the parse tree in the top-level object. For instance, if a chunk
specifying gamma correction is parsed, this will be stored as a floating-point value, rather than
multiplied by 100,000 and stored as an integer. Again, the raw data is stored in the `PARSE-TREE`
slot of the returned object, should you ever need more.

### Fully conforming with the PNG specification

Able to load all images in [PNGSuite](http://www.schaik.com/pngsuite/) correctly. png-read claims
that it can load them all, but they were not checked for validity.

### Stores data in a format that is expected by [opticl](https://github.com/slyrus/opticl)

opticl has supported pngload since its first release, which gives you faster PNG loading
automatically if you were already using opticl.

### Optionally decode metadata only

Can optionally parse only the metadata, skipping decoding completely, in order to quickly retrieve
information about an image.

### Optionally decode as a 1-dimensional array

Instead of decoding to a format which is compatible with opticl. This is useful for OpenGL texture
uploading.

### Optionally flip the Y axis

Can optionally flip the Y axis, for when the origin is expected to be at the bottom left instead of
the top left, as with OpenGL texture rendering.

### Optionally write to foreign memory

Can optionally write to foreign memory using static-vectors. This is useful when needing to
efficiently pass a pointer to the image data with a foreign library, such as OpenGL.

## Install

``` lisp
(ql:quickload :pngload)
```

## Usage

Usage is quite simple:

```lisp
(pngload:load-file #p"/path/to/file.png")
```

This will return an object which includes everything you would need to render the image data, or
query it for other useful data.

Additionally, you may load a PNG datastream from a Common Lisp stream with:

```lisp
(pngload:load-stream stream)
```

Both `LOAD-FILE` and `LOAD-STREAM` accept an optional keyword argument, which can be used to disable
the slow process of decoding the image data. This can be used to very quickly get information about
the file, including but not limited to, the dimensions, last modification date, or palette
information. Image data will be unavailable with this option, obviously. To use this fast reading
method:

```lisp
(pngload:load-file #p"/path/to/file.png" :decode nil)
```

or:

```lisp
(pngload:load-stream stream :decode nil)
```

Additionally, both `LOAD-FILE` and `LOAD-STREAM` may take the following keyword arguments:

`FLATTEN` when non-NIL, will decode the image data to a 1-dimensional array, rather than the default
method which is to be compatible with opticl.

`FLIP-Y` when non-NIL, will flip the pixels on the Y axis, for when the origin is expected to be at
the bottom/left instead of the top/left.

`STATIC-VECTOR` when non-NIL, will decode to foreign memory. It is up to the user to free memory
when they are finished with it. Alternatively, you can use `WITH-PNG-IN-STATIC-VECTOR` which will
automatically free the memory for you.
