Complete documentation for CL-FAD can be found in the 'docs'
directory or at <https://edicl.github.io/cl-fad/>.

CL-FAD also supports Nikodemus Siivola's HYPERDOC, see
<http://common-lisp.net/project/hyperdoc/> and
<http://www.cliki.net/hyperdoc>.

1. Installation

1.1. Probably the easiest way is

       (load "/path/to/cl-fad/load.lisp")

     This should compile and load CL-FAD on most Common Lisp
     implementations.

1.2. With MK:DEFSYSTEM you can make a symbolic link from
     'cl-fad.system' and 'cl-fad-test.system' to your central registry
     (which by default is in '/usr/local/lisp/Registry/') and then issue
     the command

       (mk:compile-system "cl-fad")

     Note that this relies on TRUENAME returning the original file a
     symbolic link is pointing to. This will only work with AllegroCL
     6.2 if you've applied all patches with (SYS:UPDATE-ALLEGRO).

1.3. You can also use ASDF instead of MK:DEFSYSTEM in a similar way
     (use the .asd files instead of the .system files).

1.4. Via QuickLisp:

	   (ql:quickload :cl-fad)

2. Test

CL-FAD comes with a small test suite.  To start it just load the file
"test.lisp" and evaluate (CL-FAD-TEST:TEST).
