CAVEAT: On some implementations, the GC takes care of deallocating the
arrays, while on others they need to be deallocated explicitly;
therefore, in order to make sure that deallocation works on all
implementations, you must use FREE-STATIC-VECTOR and make sure that
all references to the array are destroyed.

Furthermore, you can only allocate simple-arrays - not arrays of
element-type T and not multidimensional arrays. For use in the latter case,
you can displace a multidimensional array to a simple-array of element-type.

This library is especially useful in cases when you need to share an
array with a C/C++/Fortran library, as long as the allocation is done
on the Lisp side: e.g. as buffer for an I/O stream, et c√¶tera...
