* Version 0.13, released 2017-03-07

** bug fixes

Fixed problems reading elements into lists.

Fixed DEFKNOWN issues on newer SBCL versions.  (Thanks to Kenan Bölükbaşı.)

** new features

Float accessors are now supported on ABCL.  (Thanks to Robert Brown.)

* Version 0.12, released 2014-10-08

** bug fixes

Better support for Allegro CL modern mode.  (Thanks to Markus Flambard.)

More correct code generation for x86-64 SBCL.

** new features

Float accessors are now MAYBE-INLINE on SBCL.  (Thanks to Jan Moringen.)

* Version 0.11, released 2013-01-14

** bug fixes

IEEE-DOUBLE-REF/* now works correctly on CCL.

IEEE-SINGLE-REF/* now works correctly on Allegro.  (Thanks to Richard
Billington for the bug report.)

** new features

MAKE-OCTET-VECTOR and OCTET-VECTOR convenience functions have been
added, along with the OCTET, OCTET-VECTOR, and SIMPLE-OCTET-VECTOR
types.  (Thanks to Jan Moringen.)

Stream readers and writers for floats have been added, analogous to the
existing functions for integers.  These functionsn are only supported on
implementations which support the array accessors (SBCL, CCL, CMUCL for
double-floats; all those including Lispworks and Allegro for
single-floats).
