Programmers who lock onto a design decision and cling to it in the face of
contradictory new information -- well, that's almost everyone in my
experience, so I better not say what I think of them or people will start
saying bad things about me on c.l.l.

they got there and could not find the friend who was supposed to pay the
fare he just laughed and said he should have known.

That absolutely terrifies the herd-following, lockstep-marching,
mainstream-saluting cowards that obediently dash out or online to
scoop up books on The Latest Thing. They learn and use atrocities like
Java, C++, XML, and even Python for the security it gives them and
then sit there slaving away miserably, tediously, joylously paying off
mortgages and supporting ungrateful teenagers who despise them, only
to look out the double-sealed thermo-pane windows of their
central-heated, sound-proofed, dead-bolted, suffocating little nests
into the howling gale thinking "what do they know that I do not know?"
when they see us under a lean-to hunched over our laptops to shield
them from the rain laughing our asses off as we write great code
between bong hits.... what was the question?

giving your bold antagonist the protection they needed to shout down
