cl-asdf (2:3.3.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Bug fix release:
  * Dependency tracking: fix bugs in handling misnamed secondary systems.
    We now distinguish between "syntactic" and "semantic" primariness,
    properly warn in case a secondary system is misnamed, yet properly
    recompile or avoid spurious recompilation depending on whether
    there or not is a conflict or redefinition.
    Similarly handle package-inferred-system (thanks to Eric Timmons).
    Better warning in a fishy case of compute-action-stamp.
  * UIOP: Fix loading, allow the user to specify UIOP location from which
	to load.
  * SBCL compatibility: Fix issue with deferred warnings on SBCL.
  * Allegro compatibility: Fix issue detecting "modern" lisp.
  * Genera compatibility: Fix minor issues.  Not fully tested.
  * ECL compatibility: Bundling fixes.
  * Fiveam-ASDF: Added to contrib/ example system for integrating FiveAM
    tests with ASDF's test-op.
  * Miscellaneous fixes: Avoid an infinite loop parsing :perform options,
	quash warnings for known bad system names that won't be fixed.
  * Documentation: Multiple user-contributed documentation fixes.
  * Tests: Miscellaneous improvements.

cl-asdf (2:3.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  New milestone:
  * UIOP compatibility fix: Introduced new replacement "timestamp"
    comparison functions, because of inadvertent change in the
    API. Functions that are compatible with the old semantics are retained
    as "stamp" comparison functions, but will eventually be deprecated.
  * Upgrade fix: Upgrade from 3.2.1 needed repair.
  * Syntax manipulation: Fix for bugs that could be introduced when the
    default readtable was manipulated during the loading of a
    defsystem-depends-on system.
  * Tests: tests for new capabilities and bugs
  * Documentation: a number of improvements and clarifications.

cl-asdf (2:3.3.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  New milestone:
  * Build-plan: Extensively revised the build plan process so that
    :DEFSYSTEM-DEPENDS-ON would work correctly, even when depended on systems
    change (which didn't work before). See our ELS demonstration about it:
    "Delivering Common Lisp Applications with ASDF 3.3"
    < https://github.com/fare/asdf2017 >
  * Internals: to support the above, many ASDF internals have changed.
    ASDF now has the notion of multiple build phases to a common build session
    (which generalizes the previous build cache). ASDF considers loading a .asd
    file as an operation DEFINE-OP, and tracks as dependencies files mentioned
    during in :LOAD-FILE-FORM statements, etc. Some code has moved to new
    files or among old files, and between packages. Actions are now
    uniformly represented as a CONS of an OPERATION and a COMPONENT, where
    in some cases previously only the class of the operation was
    preserved. Forcing is constrained to be uniform across all phases of a
    top level ASDF operation invocation. Fixed the protocol for
    resetting systems being (re)defined, allowing subclasses to define
    default slot values. Remove *LOAD-SYSTEM-OPERATION*, as the current
    maintainer of ECL, for which it was originally designed, decided
    that it could never be made to work properly, after all.
  * ASDF&UIOP: Tweak dependencies between ASDF and UIOP. To avoid DEFINE-OP
    circularity, asdf.asd with no longer causes uiop.asd to be loaded.
    A standalone UIOP won't be loaded at all unless it's strictly more recent
    than ASDF.
  * Tests: tests for new capabilities and bugs. Test backtraces can be disabled.
  * Documentation: a number of improvements and clarifications.
  * Feature: a new feature :asdf3.3
  * ECL: restored the deprecated function MAKE-BUILD, removed in 3.2.0,
    in a way that works on top of supported APIs (we still recommend you migrate
    to these supported APIs). Also stop using the deprecated COMPUTE-INIT-NAME.
  * Deprecation: starting to emit STYLE-WARNINGs for deprecated
    functions.  Will gradually escalate to true WARNINGs and then ERRORs.

cl-asdf (2:3.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  New release:
  * source-registry: resolve conflicts in a way compatible with Quicklisp.
  * Upgrade: make the upgrade logic more robust, especially on CCL.
  * Require-system: better normalize module vs system names on CMUCL MKCL SBCL.
  * Logical pathnames: fix bad-system-name warning behavior when using LPNs.
  * XDG: skip empty entries, for compatibility with Ubuntu
  * Bundles: numerous fixes for bundles especially so for ECL and MKCL.
    Don't try to combine .a's as it's not portable; only ever combine but .o's.
    Getting rid of the *load-system-operation*, now it's always load-op.
  * launch-program: more fixes, notably for ECL, clasp.
  * Deprecation: fix issues with the deprecation schedule of some functions.
  * Test and Release: fixes to the release process and to a few tests.
  * Documentation: a document describing best practices when using ASDF.

cl-asdf (2:3.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  New milestone:
  * launch-program: new UIOP API for asynchronous subprocesses, now available
    on: abcl allegro clozure cmucl ecl (and lispworks os-unix) mkcl sbcl scl.
    Big thanks to Elias Pipping for this significant contribution!
  * parameter-error, not-implemented-error: new UIOP functions to better signal
    abuse of parameters in function calls, or lack of function implementation.
  * with-deprecation macro in UIOP signals style-warnings, then warnings,
    then errors when deprecated functions are used. This macro is now used
    for all deprecated functions in ASDF.
  * require-system, component-loaded-p fixed to not reload .asd files,
    and to work in presence of preloaded-systems, that are now eagerly loaded.
  * registered-system added as an abstraction for internals and extensions.
  * make-operation is now the only supported way to create an operation;
    calling make-instance directly will raise an error. Update your software!
  * Removal of several obsolete backward-compatible internals:
    if-component-dep-fails, operation-forced. Update SLIME!
  * Robustness and portability fixes all around uiop, notably dealing with
    directory access, bundles on ECL and MKCL or with cffi-toolchain,
    dealing with a fatal-condition, surviving use of "logical" pathnames, etc.
  * Tests improved and extensively run on Linux, macOS and, notably, Windows,
    with recent versions of all the maintained CL implementations.
  * Internals of ASDF systematically cleaned up and documented.
  * Build, test, release infrastructure improved, both classic and asdf-tools.
  * Documentation updated.

  Bug fix and portability release:
  * Fix compilation on Genera.
  * Fix UIOP:FILE-EXISTS-P for dotfiles on CCL.
  * Fix infinite loop in source registry configuration that can occur when
        there are cycles in the filesystem (typically caused by symlinks)
        on some CL implementations.
  * Miscellaneous bug fixes.
  * Documentation improvements.
  * Restore original Makefile.

    #1501373).
  * Fix a number of issues with bundle operations (especially on
    non-C-compiler-based implementations).
  * Fix component-finding in package-inferred-system.
  * Fix race condition between multiple concurrent lisp processes
    doing ASDF builds (ticket #1483948).
  * Fix misplaced fasl cache on Windows.
  * Miscellaneous bug fixes.
  * Documentation improvements.

cl-asdf (2:3.1.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Bug fix and portability release:
  * Add immutable-system support (thanks to Dave Cooper).  This support
    should be regarded as preliminary and subject to change.
  * Substantially improved operation on Windows: many bugfixes and improve-
    ments to UIOP functions that interface with the operating system.
  * Add CLASP support.
  * Many miscellaneous fixes for issues on individual implementations,
    notably UIOP incompatibility introduced by SBCL 1.2.12, support for
    LispWorks 7 character types, fixes to chdir on ABCL, improvements
    to run-program on Windows.
  * Added OS-COND to UIOP to paper over some incompatibilities about when
    and how operating system can be detected on different implementations.
    Made OS predicates run test at runtime so you can bind *features* from
    a target system and determine its OS.
  * Fixes to XDG configuration directory handling.  Try to stick to the
    XDG spec, rather than guessing what it should be on different platforms.
    To recognize this, change UIOP functions about XDG files to "XDG-"
    prefixes.
  * Documentation improvements.

  [ Robert P. Goldman ]
  Bug fix release:
  * Remove compatibility stubs for old bundle classes (not working
    properly, anyway), these are now available in a contrib.
  * Add INPUT-STRING function to UIOP.
  * For developer and tester convenience, bring all the external
    dependencies into the git repo as submodules. See target make ext
  * Optionally speed up registry search by providing a cache for
    the SOURCE-REGISTRY. See the cache-generating script in:
      asdf/tools/cl-source-registry-cache.lisp
  * Fixes to tests and documentation.
  * Many minor bugfixes.

cl-asdf (2:3.1.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Bug fix release:
  * A bug in 3.1.2 caused errors when hot-upgrading from 3.1.2 ASDF.
  * Fix bugs in ASDF component search caching. In some circumstances,
    aggressive caching (particularly of negative results) interfered with
    error-handling through restarts.  Also, in some cases use of caching
    interfered with error-checking. Some of these issues are discussed in
    ticket #1335323 on launchpad.
  * Miscellaneous bug fixes and tweaks to UIOP.
  * Documentation improvements.

 -- Francois-Rene Rideau <fare@tunes.org>  Mon, 14 Jul 2014 16:54:49 -0400

cl-asdf (2:3.1.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  New release:
  * ~/common-lisp/ is now present by default in the source-registry, so
    you don't need to configure anything if you put source code there.
  * package-inferred-system implements the one-file, one-package, one-system
    paradigm of quick-build and faslpath as an extension to ASDF 3.
  * non-propagating-operation replaces OPERATION for operations as a base class
    to inherit from for operations that do not propagate,
    whereas for backward compatibility with ASDF 1 and 2,
    subclasses of OPERATION implicitly propagate DOWNWARD and SIDEWAYs.
    Failure to explicitly inherit from one of the explicitly propagating
    or non-propagating classes will result in a WARNING for now.
  * Accept strings as operation class designators in DEFSYSTEM, which
    provides better integration of ASDF extensions loaded using
    DEFSYSTEM-DEPENDS-ON.
  * force-not now takes precedence over force, and systems named in the
    *immutable-systems* set (represented as an equal hash-table) are always
    forced-not, and even their .asd is not refreshed from the filesystem.
  * portability is much improved, with support for the latest GCL, and
    fixes for ABCL, CLISP, ECL, LispWorks, MKCL, SBCL, XCL, etc.
  * bundle support was refactored, with many fixes to previously uncommon cases.
    ECL support is fixed, MKCL added, with a common extension to build programs
    without pulling in UIOP and with it the compiler.
    image-op was added to create heap images for use with e.g. cl-launch.
    load-fasl-op was renamed to load-bundle-op, fasl-op to compile-bundle-op,
    binary-op to deliver-asd-op, and so forth for the monolithic- variants;
    previous names remain available for backward compatibility.
  * robustness: Test improvements and new tests.
    Added missing dependencies in asdf.asd itself(!).
    Fixes to version-satisfies (thanks to stassats), to the file-stamp cache.
    Fix to regression from 3.0.2.12 whereby ASDF failed to avoid downgrading.
    Many cleanups. Many explanatory updates to source code comments.
  * run-program tweaked again, notably on Windows, on CLISP, and
    on implementations without a native run-program. On Windows, we
    punt on trying to ensure no final space is ever echo'ed by CMD.EXE " ".
  * provide both "asdf" and "ASDF" to play nicer with various Lisps.
  * upgrading from a sufficiently forward-compatible version (currently: 2.33)
    will be less disruptive of ASDF data and enhancements in the current image:
    previously loaded systems will not be cleared anymore,
    variables defined with defparameter* will not be reset.
    Punting on upgrades from ASDF 1 for more robust behavior.
  * make is the new name for build-system, as an experimental alternative
    interface to building software with ASDF — it operates with build-op,
    which itself delegates to *load-system-operation* by default.
    Prepare-op also delegates to *load-system-operation* on systems.
    You might bind that variable to load-bundle-op instead of load-op.
  * uiop much improved so as to be used with Google's build system blaze:
    with-temporary-file, dump-image / restore-image, ensure-pathname,
    compile-file*, with-saved-deferred-warnings.
  * Added portable API to optimization settings.
  * Refine detection of operating systems. os-macosx-p and os-unix-p no
    longer mutually exclusive.
  * asdf3.1 feature pushed, to signal the slew of significant improvements
    in over a year since initial ASDF 3.0 pre-release (i.e. version 2.27).
  * Substantially rewritten, updated, and expanded manual.
  * TODO updated.

cl-asdf (2:3.0.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  New release:
  * Run-program much improved, with a slight backward incompatibility.
    See the new documentation about it.
  * Portability enhanced, with more robust Windows support,
    plus patches for CCL, CLISP, LispWorks, XCL.
  * UIOP improved, with a README, more docstrings, a few new functions
    (println, writeln, stripln, ensure-gethash, vomit-output-stream),
    and bugfixes (to ensure-function, with-temporary-file, split-string).
  * Debian installations that don't export XDG_DATA_DIRS will benefit
    from the fix to split-string, as the bug was basically disabling
    the default source-registry entry for /usr/share/common-lisp/source//
    Closes: #723977
  * Minor tweaks to the defsystem, mostly to print more information
    in some situations, less in other situations, but also to better
    handle systems with secondary names like foo/bar, a fix for user
    functions in output-translation, and to :version (:read-file-...)
  * Documentation somewhat updated.

cl-asdf (2:3.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  ASDF 3.0.1 is an emergency release for better compatibility with Quicklisp.

  * version-satisfies now uses uiop:version<= for comparison,
    and does not check for a same major version number,
    like version-compatible-p does, which was the
    undocumented behavior since ASDF 1.

cl-asdf (2:3.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  ASDF 3.0.0 is the first official release of ASDF 3;
  ASDF 2.27 to 2.33 were pre-releases.
  Since 2.33, the following changes were done:

  * Portability: have *uninteresting-conditions* be empty by default.
    Move stuff to *usual-uninteresting-conditions*, unused by default.
    Will make the SBCL team happy. Also, fix tests on ABCL.
    Fix regression of program-op on ECL, by implicitly linking in UIOP or ASDF.

  * UIOP: improvements to slurp-input-stream and thus run-program,
    notably accepting T as alias for *standard-output*,
    for better backward-compatibility of the deprecated run-shell-command.
    New macro with-output-file.

  * POIU support enhanced with various tweaks.

  * Build cleanup so make and concatenate-source-op create the same asdf.lisp

cl-asdf (2:2.33-1) unstable; urgency=low

  ASDF 2.33 is a set of cleanups since 2.32.
  Since previous release 2.32, it includes the following changes:

  * Portability tweaks for ABCL, Allegro, CCL, CLISP, ECL, LispWorks, SBCL.

  * deferred-warning received yet more improvements for CCL.

  * upgrade is made more robust in many cases, notably for ECL, SBCL,
    or when using UIOP with an old ASDF<=2.26.

  * Packages have been tweaked to pass more tests,
    notably wrt what symbols are exported.

  * Image lifecycle support is improved, thanks to deploying ASDF3 for QRes.
    More options for dump-image on CCL; handle reentrance in restore-image.

  * delete-directory-tree, delete-empty-directory, copy-file,
    directory-exists-p, file-exists-p were added to UIOP,
    also better strcat, with reduce/strcat, base-string-p, etc.

  * Recompilation avoided for things already done by defsystem-depends-on.

  * monolithic-fasl-op was fixed in cases when the main system has components.

  * fasl-op and monolithic-fasl-op now work on ABCL trunk and upcoming 1.2.0,
    and will eventually replace the ABCL-JAR contrib.

  * *uninteresting-conditions* was added as a common list of conditions
    shared between the compile-time and load-time muffled conditions.

 -- Francois-Rene Rideau <fare@tunes.org>  Thu, 04 Apr 2013 01:54:26 -0400

cl-asdf (2:2.32-1) unstable; urgency=low

  ASDF 2.31 is yet another bug fix release in preparation of an upcoming ASDF 3.
  Since previous release 2.31, it includes the following changes:

  * deferred-warning checks are now disabled by default,
    to enhance backward compatibility with ASDF 2.26 and earlier.
    In the future, we will enable them by default,
    but not until we implement a smoother transition plan.

  * UIOP is the new official name for ASDF-DRIVER.
    "Utilities for Implementation- and OS- Portability".
    Old names remain as package and system nicknames:
    . ASDF/DRIVER ASDF-DRIVER ASDF-UTILS

  * require-system so systems may depend on implementation-provided modules.

  * auto-upgrade attempt in operate *before* the implicit find-system.

  * class specification for components can now be a string to be read as a symbol.

  * feature conditional dependencies are now debugged and tested:
    . :depends-on ("some-system" (:feature :foo "other-system))
    we only recommend them for dependencies between systems;
    within systems, we recommend you use feature-conditional components with
    . :if-feature :foo
    and we only provide limited support for the deprecated legacy way of using
    feature-conditionals with a module having :if-component-dep-fails :ignore
    while its components specify things like:
    . :in-order-to ((compile-op (feature :foo)))

  * read-from-file for :version specification is made more useful by using
    the ASDF-USER package rather than CL (into which interning is forbidden)
    to read the files.

cl-asdf (2:2.31-1) unstable; urgency=low

  ASDF 2.31 is another bug fix release in preparation of an upcoming ASDF 3.
  Since previous release 2.30, it includes the following changes:

  * *default-encoding* is now UTF-8. As tested with cl-test-grid,
    This is a boon for most programs,
    that will compile in a more predictable way in a wider range of settings.
    A handful of unmaintained outliers still need to be fixed.

  * Downgrade is now explicitly avoided. ASDF will issue a warning
    if your system is misconfigured in a way that specifies downgrade,
    but will then ignore the specified ASDF downgrade.

  * version specifications, when invalid, will lead only to a warning for now;
    a future ASDF3 may restore the behavior of ASDF 2.27,
    that raises an errors when there is a bad :version specification,
    but for now, backward compatibility prevails.

  * ECL support received several bug fixes.

  * precompiled-system support was notably fixed, enabling single-fasl
    deployment of SBCL contribs.

 -- Francois-Rene Rideau <fare@tunes.org>  Mon, 25 Feb 2013 19:02:14 -0500

cl-asdf (2:2.30-1) unstable; urgency=low

  ASDF 2.30 is another bug fix release in preparation of an upcoming ASDF 3.
  Since previous release 2.29, it includes:

  * syntax around loading .asd files made more backward-compatible,
    by *not* (for now) binding *readtable* and *print-pprint-dispatch*
    to standard values, because it breaks some indelicate libraries.
    We intend to reinstate these bindings at some point in the future,
    but only after more implementations enforce the immutability
    of these standard values like SBCL does,
    and after fixed libraries have been released.
    This notably unbreaks iolib 0.7.3 (for readtable) and
    defdoc (for the pprint-dispatch table).

  * portability fixes for CCL and CMUCL.
    On CCL, punt on package upgrade, and on reify-simple-sexp.
    On CMUCL, fix raw-print-backtrace and hostname.

  * exported symbols cleaned up somewhat.

cl-asdf (2:2.29-1) unstable; urgency=low

  ASDF 2.29 is a bug fix release in preparation of an upcoming ASDF 3.
  Since previous release 2.28, it includes:

  * deferred-warnings support for Allegro, CMUCL, SCL;
    fixes to the CCL support.

  * Upgrade fixes regarding fallback system versions;
    making it possible (via massive use of eval-when)
    to compile ASDF without loading it first.

  * Compatibility with private use of :D package nickname
    by not claiming it for package ASDF/DRIVER anymore.
    Also explicitly handle NIL in safe-file-write-date,
    in case the implementation doesn't issue a file-error in that case;
    make UTF-8 the default encoding for with-input-file.
    Be portable to #+(and sbcl (not sb-eval)).

  * Bugfixes to old bugs: inline-methods can now be unqualified (lp#485393),
    defsystem-depends-on accepts arbitrary specs, not just names (lp#1027521).

cl-asdf (2:2.28-1) unstable; urgency=low

  ASDF 2.28 is a quick patch to ASDF 2.27 to make it work better with
  systems that specify a relative pathname, then at runtime (e.g. in tests)
  use merge-pathnames or merge-pathnames* against it expecting a directory.

 -- Francois-Rene Rideau <fare@tunes.org>  Fri, 01 Feb 2013 17:07:53 -0500

cl-asdf (2:2.27-1) unstable; urgency=low

  ASDF 2.27 is actually an almost complete rewrite of ASDF, and
  should be considered a pre-release for an upcoming ASDF 3.
  It nevertheless maintains backward compatibility with the current practice,
  and is tested against the software in Quicklisp.

  * ASDF-BUNDLE was merged into ASDF.
    This notably means fewer headaches for users of ECL;
    it also means a new load-fasl-op feature for all users of a modern CL,
    making it easier to deliver software as a single fasl.
    After release, I plan to offer a patch so SBCL use that for its contrib's.
    All remnants of asdf-bundle's predecessor asdf-ecl were removed.

  * DECADES-OLD bugs of notable significance were fixed:
    (a) changes in dependencies now trigger a rebuild across systems, and
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/asdf/+bug/479522
    (b) timestamps are now correctly propagated (they weren't at all!)
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/asdf/+bug/1087609
    Fixing them required a complete rewrite of ASDF's dependency tracking.
    In olden days, some have argued for not rebuilding systems that :depend-on
    a modified one as a "feature". It really isn't. On the other hand,
    it is now possible to explicitly prevent a system from being rebuilt, using
    an actual feature, :force-not, which was released in 2.21 in April 2012.

  * PREPARE-OP was introduced to fix a conceptual bug in the ASDF object model.
    It corresponds to "loading the dependencies of a component and its parents"
    and is explicitly depends-on'ed by LOAD-OP and COMPILE-OP of the component,
    instead of their implicitly depending on it via the TRAVERSE algorithm,
    which implicit dependency proved fatal in cases revealed by the above bugs.
    It propagates upward in the component hierarchy, rather than downward,
    like the TRAVERSE algorithm used to systematically propagate dependencies.

  * TRAVERSE was gutted out and factored into reusable higher-order functions
    and objects, which not only fixes the above conceptual bug, but makes for
    semantics that are simpler to implement, possible to understand,
    easier to extend, and less limited in expressivity.
    TRAVERSE doesn't automatically propagate operations
    downward the component hierarchy anymore;
    propagation is now implemented through methods on COMPONENT-DEPENDS-ON.

  * COMPONENT-DEPENDS-ON is now more powerful:
    it can express dependencies on arbitrary operation objects
    (i.e. operations of the same class can have different options)
    acting on arbitrary component objects
    (i.e. not necessarily siblings of the current component).
    The ASDF object model can now express arbitrary build graphs, with
    no more special magic for children components vs other dependencies.

  * COMPONENT-DO-FIRST is no more. It used to specify some dependencies
    that were skipped if no re-build was triggered based on local timestamps;
    except that ASDF 1 didn't let the users control it,
    and ASDF 2 only let you control it since 2.017 or so.
    In ASDF 3, COMPONENT-DEPENDS-ON is used for all dependencies,
    and all are consulted to correctly propagate timestamps.
    However actions meant for in-image side-effects are included
    only if needed, and might be visited twice by TRAVERSE,
    first without the needed-in-image-p flag, another time with.
    You can use :IN-ORDER-TO everywhere you used to use :DO-FIRST, if ever.

  * FORCE and FORCE-NOT now correctly distinguish T from :ALL in addition to
    a list of system name specifiers, as per the original specification
    (which was never implemented in ASDF 1). Additionally,
    builtin systems (such as SB-BSD-SOCKETS on SBCL) cannot be forced
    (which doesn't work on SBCL).

  * IF-FEATURE is a new attribute of components that accepts an arbitrary
    feature expression such as (:and :sbcl (:or :x86 :x86-64)),
    which when defined is a precondition to the component being enabled;
    when the expression is false, the component is disabled,
    and dependencies to it are removed.
    It replaces the misguided :if-component-dep-fails attribute of modules
    and the accompanying :feature feature, which were dropped.
    They were not very expressive, clunky to use, and relied on baking
    conceptually dubious non-local behavior in the old TRAVERSE algorithm,
    which belied the object model and defeated other features.
    Unhappily, this breaks backwards compatibility for the few who used it,
    namely sb-grovel, nibbles and ironclad.
    A minimal compatibility layer is included that allows ASDF 3 or later
    to load the SB-GROVEL of old versions of SBCL; but it won't suffice
    to load an old version of nibbles or ironclad; please upgrade them
    a recent version that was updated to support ASDF 3.

  * CONCATENATE-SOURCE-OP is a new operation that builds a single Lisp file
    from all the source files in a system,
    which allows you to develop in a structured way with many compact files,
    yet deliver a large single file. Other related operations allow you
    to load that source file, or compile and load it,
    or do the same while including all other system dependencies.
    ASDF was broken up into lots of small files, to be delivered that way.

  * FOO/BAR/BAZ names will be recognized by defsystem as having to be located
    in a file called foo.asd. This is backward compatible in the case where
    you somehow arranged to load foo.asd before to use the other subsystems,
    except now ASDF can find the subsystems by name without the main system
    definition having been loaded. See uses of function PRIMARY-SYSTEM-NAME.

  * BUILD-OP is a generic operation that can do the "right thing" for
    each system, without users having to maintain the knowledge of
    what the right thing is for each system they may indirectly depend on.

  * Convenience methods were added to most exported generic functions,
    so you can (input-files 'compile-op '(system1 "file1")) instead of
    (input-files (make-instance 'compile-op) (find-component 'system1 "file1"))
    This notably makes it much easier to interact with ASDF at the REPL
    and debug your system definitions or ASDF extensions (or modifications).

  * Packages were introduced as ASDF was broken up into small files.
    Each file now has its own package, importing and exporting functionality,
    following the style made popular by faslpath and quick-build.
    ASDF does not yet include builtin support for quick-build or faslpath
    systems and dependencies, however. Possibly in ASDF 2.28.

  * ASDF-DRIVER is a separately-usable library for Common Lisp runtime support.
    It is transcluded in asdf.lisp (i.e. when delivering ASDF as a separate
    bootstrap file, the contents of ASDF-DRIVER have been included in it),
    but can also be used as a separate ASDF system on top of an old ASDF
    (within limits: CLISP and XCL still need a recent ASDF).
    The package ASDF/DRIVER (with short nickname :D) re-exports
    all the functions that ASDF needed to run portably.

  * Pathnames are a notable part of ASDF-DRIVER, required to deal
    portably with pathnames despite the many bugs and variations
    from platform to platform. See notably in pathname.lisp,
    MERGE-PATHNAMES*, SUBPATHNAME, PARSE-UNIX-NAMESTRING,
    PARSE-NATIVE-NAMESTRING, ENSURE-PATHNAME, and many many more.

  * Pathname use by ASDF was also improved in countless small ways,
    closing more buglets that appeared in as many corner cases.
    For instance, system pathname defaulting was improved,
    and systems not associated with a file will now have NIL as their pathname,
    which will otherwise be correctly treated.
    Many things that would vary depending on implementation will work better.
    Also, although we cannot strongly enough disrecommend the use of so-called
    "logical pathnames", especially where portability matters in any way, we
    support them better than ever within the limitations of the implementation.

  * Image lifecycle support is included in ASDF-DRIVER (and thus ASDF);
    this standardizes things like access to *COMMAND-LINE-ARGUMENTS*,
    declaring an entry-point to a program, hook functions and/or a prelude
    to run before to start the main entry, and a postlude and/or hook functions
    to run before to dump an image, dumping or creating an image, etc.

  * PROGRAM-OP allows you to create standalone executables on implementations
    that support it: CLISP, Clozure CL, CMUCL ECL, LispWorks, SBCL, SCL.
    A hello-world-example system shows demonstrates how to use it.

  * Run-program is a replacement for the old run-shell-command.
    Unlike run-shell-command, it is portable to Windows as well as Unix,
    it can avoid going through a shell and will sensibly escape arguments
    when it does go through a shell, and it has a usable interface
    to either capture program output or run the program interactively.
    This supersedes run-program/ previously available from xcvb-driver,
    including several improvements and portability fixes.

  * Conditions can be selectively muffled around compilation thanks to
    the an around-compile hook and the *UNINTERESTING-COMPILER-CONDITIONS*
    parameter, and around loading with *UNINTERESTING-LOADER-CONDITIONS*
    which is _appended_ to the former during loading.
    This supersedes the functionality previously available from xcvb-driver
    and its thin wrapper asdf-condition-control, which was retired.

  * Deferred warnings for yet undefined functions, that in a single-session
    build are usually signaled at the end of a compilation unit, will be
    saved and reassembled to make each system a compilation unit of its own,
    even when compilation of file happens across multiple sessions;
    only CCL and SBCL support this feature at this time.
    I welcome patches for other compilers, for which ASDF will _not_
    wrap an implicit WITH-COMPILATION-UNIT around its operate method anymore.

  * COMPILE-FILE* was beefed up to support all these features and more,
    and the Right Thing(tm) on all implementations, including
    support for their various extensions.

  * Internals have been refactored, and some sorry features were excised.
    The semantics of OPERATION-DONE-P is simplified and now well-specified.
    FIND-COMPONENT will pass component objects through, and
    a corresponding FIND-OPERATION replaces MAKE-SUB-OPERATION.
    Many internal accessors were renamed, after checking on Quicklisp
    that no one was using them.

  * Portability updates were done for each and every implementation.
    Working support for GCL 2.6 was restored, with notable limitations
    including lack of support for output-translations or logical-pathnames.

  * TRUENAME resolution can be reliably turned off in all cases where
    ASDF was using them by setting the variable *RESOLVE-SYMLINKS* to NIL.
    This is useful if your operating system makes that operation slow,
    or if your build system uses symlinks to content-addressed storage
    in which case TRUENAME just does the wrong thing.

  * PERFORMANCE of ASDF3 is somewhat slower (about 70%) than ASDF2
    when *RESOLVE-SYMLINKS* is true, and slightly faster when it is false;
    but underneath ASDF3 does much more work than ASDF2.

  * VERSION strings can now be specified as having to be fetched
    from a file using a (:read-file-form <path>) specification,
    that can use an optional :at keyword argument to specify
    a form or subform other than the first form in the file,
    as per the utility asdf-driver:access-at. For instance,
    if your file specials.lisp is a defpackage, an in-package
    and a defparameter of the version, then you could use:
      (:read-file-form "specials.lisp" :at (2 2))
    This makes it easier for developers to manage versioning
    of one or multiple systems with a single master version location.

  * COMPONENT-PROPERTY and the :PROPERTIES initarg of defsystem are deprecated;
    though they are still supported for now, we intend to retire them
    in a hypothetical future ASDF 4. To replace them, we recommend you instead
    define a subclass of asdf:system, with new slots and/or initargs, and
    use them with the :defsystem-depends-on and :class options of defsystem.
    We looked at usage of in Quicklisp systems, and added to asdf:system
    these slots corresponding to the general-purpose metadata we saw:
    :homepage :bug-tracker :mailto :long-name

  * Self-Upgrade of ASDF will happen automatically as the first thing
    before any attempt to build anything, as it was determined that
    doing it in the midst of a build breaks everything, and it is not
    otherwise possible to reliably detect in advance whether ASDF may
    be needed in such midst. If you don't want an ASDF upgrade, just
    don't configure your source-registry to include any copy of ASDF.

  * DEFINE-PACKAGE is provided as a replacement to DEFPACKAGE that supports
    hot upgrade of software where some packages have changed.
    It also provides new forms :MIX and :REEXPORT which can be quite practical.

  * ASDF-USER is now the shared package in which all .asd files are loaded.
    There will be no more temporary packages created
    around the loading of each .asd file. This shouldn't change much for users:
    you should probably still define your own private package whenever you
    define new classes, functions, or variables, to avoid namespace conflict;
    except now, when you don't, you can still access your defined symbols
    after the file is loaded.
    ASDF is not the right place to fix Common Lisp namespace issues, and
    these temporary packages were never a successful fix anyway;
    indeed, users were still required to define their own package as soon
    as they wanted to define variables, functions and classes
    in the system file.

  * ASDF3 was added to the *features* so you can detect the presence of
    this massively updated ASDF and its new features with #+asdf3.

  * Documentation received some updates, though by no means comparable
    to the complete rewrite of the code base.

  * Tests were updated, notably including support for bundles, encodings,
    run-program, and more. They were successfully run on
      abcl allegro allegromodern ccl clisp cmucl
      ecl ecl_bytecodes lispworks sbcl scl xcl
    Manual tests were run on gcl2.6 genera lispworks-personal-edition.
    Untested remain cormancl mkcl rmcl.
    The internal test system itself was massively improved.

  * ASDF-DEBUG is a simple utility to make your favorite debugging primitives
    available in the package you're debugging. See contrib/debug.lisp
    and the asdf/utility:*asdf-debug-utility* variable.

  * ASDF-UTILS is now but an empty shell that depends-on ASDF-DRIVER.
    The ASDF-DRIVER package has the ASDF-UTILS nickname, and exports
    all the functionality that used to be in ASDF-UTILS, and much more,
    minus a few misdesigned things from ASDF1 that you ought not
    to have been using, and for which there are non-broken replacements.
    ASDF-UTILS was distributed separately from ASDF; ASDF-DRIVER is available
    both as part of ASDF 3 and later and separately.

  * POIU was updated. This extension is still distributed separately from ASDF.
    It is now much simplified and made correct by construction by
    reusing the new TRAVERSE infrastructure of ASDF and now being able to
    assume the ASDF object model is a complete description of dependencies.
    On SBCL it will handle deferred warnings from background compilations.
    Where forking is not supported or not possible because of threads,
    it will gracefully fall back to serial compilation.

  * INFERIOR-SHELL (distributed separately) was updated to use asdf-driver
    instead of xcvb-driver. It notably provides a richer interface to
    the RUN-PROGRAM functionality.

  * SLIME support for ASDF was significantly enhanced.
    It is distributed with SLIME, separately from ASDF.
    See latest slime checkin from 2013-01-29.
    It requires ASDF 2.014.6 or later (as used by 2011 quicklisp releases).
    We recommend that you should include slime-asdf in your slime-setup
    and that in your ~/.swank.lisp you should include:
    (in-package :swank)
    (pushnew 'try-compile-file-with-asdf *compile-file-for-emacs-hook*)

  * New features:
    * Most importantly, encodings.
      ASDF now lets you specify an :encoding for a system, module or component,
      that is used when loading or compiling Lisp files. See the documentation.
      By default, the only useful value is :utf-8, and
      we recommend you use UTF-8 everywhere.
      We intend to make UTF-8 the default in the future
      (current default is the legacy behavior of using whichever implicit
      default your underlying implementation is currently configured to use).
      An extension asdf-encodings is available that supports more encodings,
      including autodetection of encoding from either emacs-style declaration
      -*- Mode: Lisp ; coding: utf-8 -*- or content.
    * require-system works like load-system, but won't try to load or update
      systems that have already been loaded, as listed by loaded-systems.
      More generally, you can specify a list of systems as :force-not argument
      to load-system and the specified systems won't be loaded or updated.
    * You can specify :force-not and a list of systems when loading a system,
    * You can now specify :hostname in your asdf-output-translations,
      so you can easily share a home directory via the network
      yet split its fasl cache between several subtly different machines.
  * Bug Fixes:
    * lp#982285. since 2.014.4, the default source-registry
      was skipping anything from /usr or XDG_DATA_DIRS,
      because of a missing test in getenv-absolute-pathnames. Fixed in .15.
    * In 2.019.9 aka 2.20, ECL support was broken by using
      a function in the wrong package (defined in cl-user). Fixed in .1.
    * logical-pathname support was somewhat broken since 2.017.6,
      due to the way most implementations fail to read physical namestrings
      when *default-pathname-defaults* is a logical-pathname.
      Fixed, together with other logical-pathname issues, and
      a test case was added to the test suite to ensure no further regression.
      Works great modulo quirks around implementation bugs on CLISP and Allegro.
    * Make upgrading ASDF more robust on CMUCL, LispWorks, SBCL.
  * Minor tweaks:
    * Use :unspecific in pathname components on more implementations.
    * export and/or document more utilities.
    * add a few missing compatfmt for Genera.

  Bugs:
  * Solved a bug due to ASDF reusing components even when the ASDF definition
    has changed wildly, leading to bad behavior in incremental compilation
    and sometimes total failure of compilation of a new version.
    (Thanks to Xach for reporting and RPGoldman for fixing.)
  * Fix an issue with ASDF doing the wrong thing in case of a clock skew,
    thanks to Andreas Fuchs.
  * Simplification of the internals of perform-with-restarts and
   traverse's do-dep, that should fix some corner cases and make it
   easier to extend or further fix. There scarily doesn't remain
   any unedited code from Dan Barlow's original ASDF, though
   much of the interface design is preserved.
  * Upgrade code slightly simplified, with a particular fix for CLISP;
   it is now tested on all supported implementations, not just SBCL.
  * Improvements to tests and documentation.

  Portability:
  * Many implementation specific improvements for ECL:
   merge with the ECL upstream version, support for the bytecode compiler.
  * Because it is required at least on ABCL, made the Unix vs Windows detection
   a runtime rather than compile-time distinction
   No more asdf-unix or asdf-windows feature, but
   (asdf::os-unix-p) and (asdf::os-windows-p) functions (not exported for now).
   Also recognize darwin as Unix ECL.
  * Also small improvements for SCL.

  Features:
  * Bind *default-pathname-defaults* around load-sysdef,
   to increase chances of successful pathname parsing in defsystem.
  * Fixed run-shell-command on allegro/unix and clisp,
   documented the function, noted how it mightn't do what you think on Windows,
   marked it as obsolete, promoted as an official replacement my new
       xcvb-driver:run-program/process-output-stream
  * New :around-compile hook so you can control the syntax, optimization,

  Promoting 2.016.3 as 2.017. Since 2.016, we have the following improvements:
  * ABCL: jar translation happier with recent compile-file-pathname* change.
  * CCL: see truenamize change below.
  * GCL: vain partially reverted attempts at making GCL 2.6 and 2.7 fail less.
  * LispWorks: use probe-file for probe-file*
  * RMCL: location strings are now POSIX namestrings.
    You can thus share configuration files and environment variables
    between RMCL and other Lisp implementations on same host.
    Use #p"" syntax when you insist on using MacOS 9 style MCL pathnames.
  * truenamize: happier when e.g. the *default-pathname-defaults* is #p"",
    which is the case notably on CCL.
  * Logical pathnames: now preserved by the source-registry's tree directive.
  * Upgrade: instead of unintern'ing symbols, use fmakunbound;
    however, treat compilation of asdf specially, by always making sure
    it is loaded as source before it is compiled,
    so that compilation is never an upgrade and never calls fmakunbound, thus
    ensuring functions in the continuation of compilation are always fbound.
  * Obsolete: dropped support for *system-cache* and get-uid.

cl-asdf (2:2.016-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Promoting 2.015.12 as 2.016. Since 2.015, we have the following improvements:
  * Portability: fixes for ECL, RMCL, CLISP.
    Improvements to Windows configuration.
  * Fix to load-source-op (broken in 2.014.13).
  * Avoid infinite loops in defsystem in cases of bad interference
    between quicklisp and your source-registry.
  * Small fixes regarding upgrade, compile-file* :output-file.
  * Make defsystem-depends-on much more useful by allowing a system
    thus depended on to define the class of the system depending on it.
  * Some documentation updates.
    Notably, for the sake of CLISP, (require "asdf") is the new canonical way
    to load ASDF, instead of (require :asdf). Sigh.
  * Better tests, notably wrt hot upgrade.

cl-asdf (2:2.015-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Promoting 2.014.17 as 2.015. Since 2.014, we have the following improvements:
  * Portability: support cormanlisp, xcl;
    fixes for cmucl, ecl; tweaks for abcl, allegro, clisp, genera, lispworks.
  * Feature: un-cerror and actually fix the :force '(sys1 sys2 sys3) feature,
    introduced in 2002 and never working before.
  * Feature: classes asdf:cl-source-file.cl and asdf:cl-source-file.lsp
    for people who use these file type extensions.
  * Semantic change: the source-registry eagerly gathers a list of .asd,
    rather than querying the filesystem over and over again.
  * API change: exposing function asdf:search-for-system-definition as looking
    through asdf:*system-definition-search-functions* for either pathnames *or*
    (new feature) system objects. Should make quicklisp happier.
  * Better support for asdf upgrading itself, with new function
    asdf:upgrade-asdf that knows to invalidate old systems when necessary,
    and is magically invoked before to build any system that :depends-on asdf.
    Make upgrade smoother some cases that were previously broken.
  * More robust handling of version strings.
  * Declaring function asdf:system-definition-pathname obsolete, but still
    supporting it for now, as an alias for asdf:system-source-file.
  * Various refactorings of internals. Splitting a function asdf::perform-plan
    out of the default asdf:operate method.
    asdf::register-system now takes only one argument.
  * Tests to prevent the regressions experienced during this development cycle
  * Tried and reverted: attempts to make asdf more verbose when it's verbose,
    but not verbose by default.

cl-asdf (1.109-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream. Major changes:
     + main change is the addition of system-relative-pathname function. This takes a
       system name and a partial pathname and combines them to return a new pathname
       _relative_ to the system. This is exported and lightly documented.
     + this patch also updates preference-file-for-system/operation in an effort
       to prevent it from being confused by *default-pathname-defaults* that include
       a specific name and type.
     + Removes inline component methods more carefully (and, I believe, correctly!). Helps keep LispWorks happy.
     + Reworked asdf tests to make them more robust and perhaps more flexible too.
  * Now use texlive to build.

   time rather than (package-name *package*); this keeps case sensitive Lisps
   happy all the time and keeps case insensitive lisps happily insensitive.

      + A patch from Richard Kreuter that allows pathname defaulting to work
   better with *load-truename* and *default-pathname-defaults*; this makes it
   easier to work with defsystems in the REPL.
