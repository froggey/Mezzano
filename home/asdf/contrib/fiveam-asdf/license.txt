FIVEAM-ASDF is a library enabling suites of FiveAM tests to be
associated with ASDF systems in such a way that ASDF:TEST-SYSTEM will
cause the tests to be run and will raise an exception if something
unexpected happens.

FIVEAM-ASDF is licensed under the terms of the Lisp Lesser GNU
Public License (http://opensource.franz.com/preamble.html), known as
the LLGPL.  The LLGPL consists of a preamble (see above URL) and the
