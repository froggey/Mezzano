# -*- Makefile -*- This minimal Makefile delegates most work to the asdf-tools script
#
# End-Users, all you need to do is:
#   make -f Makefile-lisp-scripting
#
# Vendors, you may want to test your implementation with:
#   make -f Makefile-lisp-scripting test l=sbcl
# BUT you first need have installed the development-time external dependencies of ASDF;
# this will be done automatically if you are using quicklisp;
# you can do it manually with your favorite tools (e.g. clbuild or git);
# or you can do it using `git submodule update` which is also available as:
#   make -f Makefile-lisp-scripting ext
# To undo the `git submodule update` you can use: `make noext`
#
# Other targets are for maintainer use only. If you want a list of all of the targets, use
#   make -f Makefile-lisp-scripting help
#
### Default fall back rule: delegate to asdf-tools.
# Note that the l= L= etc. are the only way I (Far√©) have found to
# pass arguments from the Makefile to the underlying script:
# l= overrides $ASDF_TEST_LISPS to specify which lisp implementations to use
# L= overrides $ASDF_UPGRADE_TEST_LISPS (defaults to the former) to lisps during upgrade
# s= overrides $ASDF_TEST_SYSTEMS to specify systems with which to test ASDF
# t= overrides $ASDF_TESTS to specify test script patterns to use (default to *.script)
# u= overrides $ASDF_UPGRADE_TEST_TAGS to specify versions to upgrade from (e.g. 3.0.3 or REQUIRE)
# U= overrides $ASDF_UPGRADE_TEST_METHODS to specify upgrade methods
# v= overrides the default next version for bump-version or bump.
# see in tools/test-environment.lisp for details.
# Note that because of how make and the shell quote arguments,
# thou shalt not use the single-quote character in any of the short x= parameters
# (but you may use them in the long variant in the exported environment variable).
# To have a list of commands, see make help or ./tools/asdf-tools help
# Note that when you call ./tools/asdf-tools directly,
# you may have to use positional parameters instead (unless you use env as below), as in
#   ./tools/asdf-tools bump 3.2.1
# instead of
#   make -f Makefile-lisp-scripting bump v=3.2.1
# or
#   ./make-asdf.sh v=3.2.1 bump
# or
#   ./tools/asdf-tools env v=3.2.1 bump
# or
#   v=3.2.1 ./tools/asdf-tools bump
