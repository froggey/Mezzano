Marc Battyani: marc.battyani@fractalconcept.com or marc@battyani.net

Note that though this licence has no advertising clause anymore, it is
recommenced that applications using cl-pdf/cl-typesetting, like Web servers,
Web applications or native applications, insert somewhere (in the about or
credits page for instance) "Document(s) generated with cl-pdf/cl-typesetting"
This is not a licence requirement and is only asked as a way to to help 
promote the Common Lisp language.
