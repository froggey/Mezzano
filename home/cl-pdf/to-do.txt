If you have some time and want to contribute, here are some things needed by cl-pdf.
This list is not exhaustive

Charts improvements:
       more chart types
       more options (3D ?)
       correct sizing model

Higher level graphical functions.

Syntax converters (SVG, VML, ?)

Make compression work with ACL Windows (currently I can't get the
  character-encoding to be compatible for that platform combo).
