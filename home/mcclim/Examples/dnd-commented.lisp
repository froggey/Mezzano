~
This demo is is made to present various approaches to implementing ~
drag and drop. See the source code for inline comments describing ~
implementation. We explore four different approaches: custom panes ~
which handle events and repaint all by themself, TRACKING-POINTER ~
semi-automated approach, dragging-output (and draw-output-record) and ~
finally drag-and-drop translators.

Custom pane
-----------

Ad-hoc implementation not concerning itself with any interoperation ~
with presentations and typed input. Pane is not a stream. Clicking ~
anywhere on the pane starts dragging and releasing the button ends ~
it. All work is done in two methods: HANDLE-REPAINT and HANDLE-EVENT.

Pointer tracking
----------------

Macro TRACKING-POINTER is a basic block for implementing drag-and-drop ~
in applications. It allows specifying input context and drawing may be ~
done from handlers which are assigned to different event types (like ~
pointer motion). Using POINTER-TRACKING and POINTER-TRACKING* commands ~
disables other CLIM processing and allows dragging \"What-X\" elements ~
to the \"What acceptor\". The difference between to commands is that ~
one allows dragging across different sheets while the other doesn't ~
allow that.

Dragging-output
---------------

Dragging-output is built on top of TRACKING-POINTER. It allows moving ~
output records and see a visible feedback. To test it click on the ~
cross and click at its destination. Circle should be shown as a ~
feedback. No further action is done.

Drag and drop translators
-------------------------

These translators in principle should allow producing an object of ~
type C by dragging A towards B. Translator body is responsible for ~
producing the object. Common use for that is returning a command for ~
which there is an active input-context from DEFAULT-FRAME-TOP-LEVEL.

In demo we have two base presentations: FIGURE and BASKET. We put ~
figures to their corresponding baskets (CIRCLEs to CIRCLE-BASKET, ~
SQUAREs to SQUARE-BASKET, TRIANGLEs to TRIANGLE-BASKET). There is a ~
general purpose basket called FIGURE-BASKET to which all figures ~
should fit. That's a basic operation mode.

Gray circles do not inherit from FIGURE and they are not accepted in ~
figure baskets. There is a GREY-CIRCLE-ACCEPTOR for them. We define ~
two additional compound (OR-ed) presentation types:

SIDEFUL-FIGURE  -- (or SQUARE TRIANGLE)
SIDELESS-FIGURE -- (or CIRCLE GREY-CIRCLE)

For both these types there are SIDEFUL-FIGURE-BASKET and ~
SIDLESS-FIGURE-ACCEPTOR.

Known issues
------------

- Compound destination types can't be dropped onto.

Fixing that requires reworking frame-drag-and-drop method to accept ~
any presentation in tracking-pointer and check type as we go.")))
