    rescanning buffers with accept extents doesn't work reliably,
    especially in accepting-values.

    The default present methods, and those for Lisp types, should be
    more careful about :acceptably. In the same vein,
    command-line-command-unparser should be prepared to emit
    accept-extents (how?) if the arguments aren't acceptable as text.

    These are TODO's from the 0.9 release notes. The listed functions
    are unimplemented unless otherwise noted.

    General designs need more work, particularly the support of
    compositing.

    Changing the sheet-transformation of a pane does not alter its
    native transformation, despite the fact that calls are made to
    invalidate-cached-transformations and
    note-sheet-transformation-changed.  Perhaps this code is
    responsible:  

    (defmethod invalidate-cached-transformations ((sheet mirrored-sheet-mixin))
      (with-slots (native-transformation device-transformation) sheet
	(setf ;; native-transformation nil XXX hm...
	      device-transformation nil))
      (loop for child in (sheet-children sheet)
	    do (invalidate-cached-transformations child)))

RS:20030805:101708
    The way the text-field pane handles keyboard input focus (by
    remembering who had it before and restoring it) does not work very
    well with respect to other X applications.  It would be better for
    each pane to decide when it wants the input focus.

    A compound output recording record structure based on R trees or
    another spatial data structure is needed. [Implemented by
    Christophe Rhodes and Andreas Fuchs].

    Output recording is broken for records that inherit from
    coord-seq-mixin.  Contrary to comments in the code, the coordinate
    sequence is not transformed before the output record is created.
    [resolved by moore and hefner in various ways]
