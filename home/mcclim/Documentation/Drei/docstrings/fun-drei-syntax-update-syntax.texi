Method combination: @code{VALUES-MAX-MIN} (@w{most-specific-last})

Inform the syntax module that it must update
its view of the buffer. @code{unchanged-prefix} @code{unchanged-suffix}
indicate what parts of the buffer has not been changed. @code{begin}
and @code{end} are offsets specifying the minimum region of the buffer
that must have an up-to-date parse, defaulting to 0 and the size
of the buffer respectively. It is perfectly valid for a syntax to
ignore these hints and just make sure the entire syntax tree is
up to date, but it *must* make sure at at least the region
delimited by @code{begin} and @code{end} has an up to date parse. Returns
two values, offsets into the buffer of the syntax, denoting the
buffer region thas has an up to date parse.
