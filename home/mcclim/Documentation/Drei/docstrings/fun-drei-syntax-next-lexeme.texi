@deffn {Generic Function} {drei-syntax:next-lexeme} lexer scan
@findex drei-syntax:next-lexeme
This generic function is called by the
incremental lexer to get a new lexeme from the buffer.  Client
code must supply a method for this function that specializes on
the lexer class.  It is guaranteed that scan is not at the end of
the buffer, and that the first object after scan is not an
inter-lexeme object.  Thus, a lexeme should always be returned by
this function.
