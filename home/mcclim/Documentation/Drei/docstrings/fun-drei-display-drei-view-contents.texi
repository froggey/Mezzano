@deffn {Generic Function} {drei:display-drei-view-contents} stream view
@findex drei:display-drei-view-contents
The purpose of this function is to display the
contents of a Drei view to some output surface. @code{stream} is the
CLIM output stream that redisplay should be performed on, @code{view}
is the Drei view instance that is being displayed. Methods
defined for this generic function can draw whatever they want,
but they should not assume that they are the only user of
@code{stream}, unless the @code{stream} argument has been specialized to
some application-specific pane class that can guarantee this. For
example, when accepting multiple values using the
@code{accepting-values} macro, several Drei instances will be
displayed simultaneously on the same stream. It is permitted to
only specialise @code{stream} on @code{clim-stream-pane} and not
@code{extended-output-stream}. When writing methods for this function,
be aware that you cannot assume that the buffer will contain only
characters, and that any subsequence of the buffer is coercable
to a string. Drei buffers can contain arbitrary objects, and
redisplay methods are required to handle this (though they are
not required to handle it nicely, they can just ignore the
object, or display the @code{princ}ed representation.)
