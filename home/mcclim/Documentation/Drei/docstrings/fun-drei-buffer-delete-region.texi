@deffn {Generic Function} {drei-buffer:delete-region} mark1 mark2
@findex drei-buffer:delete-region
Delete the objects in the buffer that are
between @code{mark1} and @code{mark2}.  An error is signaled if the two
marks are positioned in different buffers.  It is acceptable to
pass an offset in place of one of the marks. This function calls
@code{delete-buffer-range} with the appropriate arguments.
