@findex drei-syntax:skip-inter-lexeme-objects
This generic function is called by the
incremental lexer to skip inter-lexeme buffer objects.  The
default method for this generic function increments the scan mark
until the object after the mark is not an inter-lexeme object, or
until the end of the buffer has been reached.
