@deffn {Generic Function} {drei:display-drei-view-cursor} stream view cursor
@findex drei:display-drei-view-cursor
The purpose of this function is to display a
visible indication of a cursor of a Drei view to some output
surface. @code{stream} is the CLIM output stream that drawing should
be performed on, @code{view} is the Drei view object that is being
redisplayed, @code{cursor} is the cursor object to be displayed (a
subclass of @code{drei-cursor}) and @code{syntax} is the syntax object of
@code{view}. Methods on this generic function can draw whatever they
want, but they should not assume that they are the only user of
@code{stream}, unless the @code{stream} argument has been specialized to
some application-specific pane class that can guarantee this. It
is permitted to only specialise @code{stream} on @code{clim-stream-pane}
and not @code{extended-output-stream}. It is recommended to use the
function @code{offset-to-screen-position} to determine where to draw
the visual representation for the cursor. It is also recommended
to use the ink specified by @code{cursor} to perform the drawing, if
applicable. This method will only be called by the Drei redisplay
engine when the cursor is active and the buffer position it
refers to is on display @code{-} therefore, @code{offset-to-screen-position}
is *guaranteed* to not return NIL or @code{t}.
