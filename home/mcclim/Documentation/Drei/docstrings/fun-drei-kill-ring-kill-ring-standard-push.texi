@findex drei-kill-ring:kill-ring-standard-push
Pushes a vector of objects onto the kill ring
creating a new start of ring position.  This function is much
like an everyday Lisp push with size considerations.  If the
length of the kill ring is greater than the maximum size, then
"older" elements will be removed from the ring until the
maximum size is reached.
