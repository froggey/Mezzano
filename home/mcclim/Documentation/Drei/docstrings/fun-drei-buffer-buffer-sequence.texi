Return the contents of the buffer starting at
@code{offset1} and ending at offset2-1 as a sequence.  If either of
the offsets is less than zero or greater than or equal to the
size of the buffer, a @code{no-such-offset} condition is signaled.  If
@code{offset2} is smaller than or equal to @code{offset1}, an empty
sequence will be returned.
