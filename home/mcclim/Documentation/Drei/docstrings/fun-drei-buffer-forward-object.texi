@deffn {Generic Function} {drei-buffer:forward-object} mark &optional count
@findex drei-buffer:forward-object
Move the mark forward the number of positions
indicated by count.  This function could be implemented by an
@code{incf} on the offset of the mark, but many buffer implementations
can implement this function much more efficiently in a different
way.  A @code{motion-before-beginning} condition is signaled if the
resulting offset of the mark is less than zero. A
@code{motion-after-end} condition is signaled if the resulting offset
of the mark is greater than the size of the buffer. Returns
@code{mark}.
