@deffn {Generic Function} {drei-syntax:additional-command-tables} editor command-table
@findex drei-syntax:additional-command-tables
Method combination: @code{APPEND} (@w{most-specific-first})

Return a list of additional command tables
that should be checked for commands in addition to those
@code{command-table} inherits from. The idea is that methods are
specialised to @code{editor} (which is at first a Drei instance), and
that those methods may call the function again recursively with a
new @code{editor} argument to provide arbitrary granularity for
command-table-selection. For instance, some commands may be
applicable in a situation where the editor is a pane or gadget in
its own right, but not when it functions as an input-editor. In
this case, a method could be defined for @code{application-frame} as
the @code{editor} argument, that calls @code{additional-command-tables}
again with whatever the "current" editor instance is. The
default method on this generic function just returns the empty
list.
