@deffn {Generic Function} {drei-undo:undo} undo-tree &optional n
@findex drei-undo:undo
Move the current state @code{n} steps up the undo
tree and call @code{flip-undo-record} on each step.  If the current
state is at a level less than @code{n}, a @code{no-more-undo} condition is
signaled and the current state is not moved (and no calls to
@code{flip-undo-record} are made).

As long as no new record are added to the tree, the undo module
remembers which branch it was in before a sequence of calls to undo.
