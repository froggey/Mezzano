@findex drei-undo:redo
Move the current state @code{n} steps down the
remembered branch of the undo tree and call @code{flip-undo-record} on
each step.  If the remembered branch is shorter than @code{n}, a
@code{no-more-undo} condition is signaled and the current state is not
moved (and no calls to @code{flip-undo-record} are made).
