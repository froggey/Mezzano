@deffn {Macro} {drei:performing-drei-operations} (drei &rest args &key with-undo redisplay) &body body
@findex drei:performing-drei-operations
Provide various Drei maintenance services around the
evaluation of @code{body}. This macro provides a convenient way to
perform some operations on a Drei, and make sure that they are
properly reflected in the undo tree, that the Drei is
redisplayed, the syntax updated, etc. Exactly what is done can be
controlled via the keyword arguments. Note that if @code{with-undo} is
false, the *entire* undo history will be cleared after @code{body} has
been evaluated. This macro expands into a call to
@code{invoke-performing-drei-operations}.
