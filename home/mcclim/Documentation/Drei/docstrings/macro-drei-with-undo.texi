@deffn {Macro} {drei:with-undo} (get-buffers-exp) &body body
@findex drei:with-undo
This macro executes the forms of @code{body}, registering changes
made to the list of buffers retrieved by evaluating
@code{get-buffers-exp}. When @code{body} has run, for each buffer it will
call @code{add-undo} with an undo record and the undo tree of the
buffer.  If the changes done by @code{body} to the buffer has resulted
in only a single undo record, it is passed as is to @code{add-undo}.
If it contains several undo records, a compound undo record is
constructed out of the list and passed to @code{add-undo}.  Finally,
if the buffer has no undo records, @code{add-undo} is not called at
all.
