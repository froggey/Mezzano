@findex drei-syntax:define-syntax-command-table
Define a syntax command table class with the provided name, as
well as defining a CLIM command table of the same name. @code{args}
will be passed on to @code{make-command-table}. An :around method on
@code{command-table-inherit-from} for the defined class will also be
defined. This method will make sure that when an instance of the
syntax command table is asked for its inherited command tables,
it will return those of the defined CLIM command table, as well
as those provided by methods on
@code{additional-command-tables}. Command tables provided through
@code{additional-command-tables} will take precence over those
specified in the usual way with :inherit-from.
