@findex drei:performing-undo
If true, the buffer is currently performing an
undo operation. The :before methods on @code{insert-buffer-object},
@code{insert-buffer-sequence}, and @code{delete-buffer-range} push undo
records onto the undo accumulator only if @code{performing-undo} is
false, so that no undo information is added as a result of an
undo operation.
