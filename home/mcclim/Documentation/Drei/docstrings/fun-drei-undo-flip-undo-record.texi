@deffn {Generic Function} {drei-undo:flip-undo-record} undo-record
@findex drei-undo:flip-undo-record
This function is called by the undo module whenever
the current state is changed from its current value to that of the
parent state (presumably as a result of a call to undo) or to that of
one of its child states.

Client code is required to supply methods for this function on
client-specific subclasses of @code{undo-record}.
