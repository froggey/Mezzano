@deffn {Generic Function} {drei:undo-accumulate} buffer
@findex drei:undo-accumulate
A list of the changes that have been made to
@code{buffer} since the last time undo was added to the undo tree for
the buffer. The list returned by this function is initially
NIL (the empty list). The :before methods on
@code{insert-buffer-object}, @code{insert-buffer-sequence}, and
@code{delete-buffer-range} push undo records on to this list.
