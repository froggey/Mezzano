@deffn {Generic Function} {drei-buffer:region-to-sequence} mark1 mark2
@findex drei-buffer:region-to-sequence
Return a freshly allocated sequence of the
objects after @code{mark1} and before @code{mark2}.  An error is signaled
if the two marks are positioned in different buffers.  If mark1
is positioned at an offset equal to or greater than that of
@code{mark2}, an empty sequence is returned.  It is acceptable to pass
an offset in place of one of the marks. This function calls
@code{buffer-sequence} with the appropriate arguments.
