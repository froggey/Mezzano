RELEASE NOTES FOR McCLIM 0.9.5, "Eastern Orthodox Liturgical New Year":

Compatibility
=============

This release was tested and found to work on the following
implementations:

 * SBCL
 * OpenMCL
 * CLISP (requires "Telent" CLX)
 * Allegro Common Lisp 8.0 in ANSI Mode

In our tests, this release of McCLIM did not work on the following
implementations:

 * CMUCL (at the time of this release, the released CMUCL has a bug
   that prevents successful loading of McCLIM; CMUCL 19d + patch 1 and
   the 2006-12 snapshot or later contain a fix for this problem)

Also, McCLIM currently does not support lisps with case-sensitive
readers (Allegro CL "modern mode" and lower-case Scieneer CL).


Changes in mcclim-0.9.5 "Eastern Orthodox Liturgical New Year" 
relative to 0.9.4:
==============================================================

From the NEWS file:

* Changes in mcclim-0.9.5 relative to 0.9.4:
** Installation: the systems clim-listener, clim-examples,
   and clouseau can now be loaded without loading the system mcclim
   first. Users with existing McCLIM installations should use the 
   provided script:
   		./symlink-asd-files.sh /path/to/asdf-central-registry/
** New extension: tab-layout. This extension allows keeping a stack of panes 
   whose foreground pane is controlled by a tab bar. This layout can be 
   customized in backends and frame managers. For examples, see the
   gtkairo backend and the pixie frame manager.
** New extension function: SHEET-RGB-IMAGE: makes a screenshot of a sheet 
   in the CLX backend. (Supported on truecolor visuals only for now.)
** New experimental extension: tree-with-cross-edges are an extension to
   the graph formatter.
** New experimental backend: clim-graphic-forms: native widgets on Windows. 
   This backend is still very experimental (it doesn't run demos yet).
** New inspector feature: The inspector now displays more useful information
   about hash tables and generic functions.
** Specification compliance: Various layout panes no longer quite as
   aggressive at eating the space requirements of their children.
** Specification compliance: There is now a rudimentary implementation of 
   NOTIFY-USER
** Usability: Text editors and text input panes now use click-to-focus.
** Improvement: the ACCEPTING-VALUES command table was renamed to 
   ACCEPT-VALUES (as this is the name that the other clim-2 implementation 
   uses)
** Improvement: the CLX backend should no longer cause focus stealing
   when an application has text-editor panes.  This change comes with
   a rudimentary click-to-focus-keyboard widget policy.
** Improvement: define-application-frame now allows a :default-initargs
   option. (This is not exactly a "specification compliance" fix, as 
   d-a-frame is not defined to accept this option.).
** Improvement: menu-choose menus now look a little prettier.
** Improvement: added more styles for bordered-output: :rounded, :ellipse
** Improvement: Toggle button values now default to NIL.
** Improvement: Frame layouts are now inherited from the frame's 
   superclass.
** Improvement: The Lisp Syntax is much improved: now recognizes 
   delimiter characters, and more types of Lambda lists.
** Bug fix: Bezier designs should now draw in the right place in all 
   backends.
** Bug fix: Text in Drei no longer "walks" to the left.
** Bug fix: Drei now has better support for delimiter gestures.
** Bug fix: Partial commands now work better when invoked from the menu.
