* Changes in mcclim-0.9.6 relative to 0.9.5:
** Bug fix: ESA's help commands are better at finding bindings and
   describing them
** Bug fix: Some missing methods and functions have been implemented
   for the Null backend, allowing headless operation for many
   applications.
** Specification compliance: READ-BITMAP-FILE and
   MAKE-PATTERN-FROM-BITMAP-FILE from CLIM 2.2. Includes new example
   program, IMAGE-VIEWER.
** Drei improvements
*** New redisplay engine that is faster and has more features.
*** Support for "views" concept.
*** Support for modes a la Emacs "mini-modes".
*** Bug fix: Input prompting now works for directly recursive calls to
    ACCEPT.
*** Improvement: Goal-columns for line movement.
*** Improvement: More Emacs-like expression movement for Lisp syntax.
** Bug fix: label panes no longer have a restrictive maximum width.
** Bug fix: ellipses with a zero radius no longer cause errors.
** Bug fix: bezier drawing in CLIM-FIG less likely to cause errors.
** Bug fix: restored somewhat working undo in CLIM-FIG.
** Specification compliance: The :inherit-menu keyword argument to
   DEFINE-COMMAND-TABLE and MAKE-COMMAND-TABLE is now implemented with
   CLIM 2.2 semantics. The :keystrokes value is not handled yet.
** Specification compliance: :PRINTER functions for MENU-CHOOSE are
   now called with the menu item, not the display object.
** Improvement: Faster drawing and AA text rendering. AA text requires
   a fix to the Xrender support of CLX, available in Christophe Rhodes's
   current CLX distribution from darcs.
** Improvement: Look up arbitrary truetype fonts by name via fontconfig.
** New extension: mcclim-truetype: provides a 100% lisp path for 
   AA fonts with CLX using cl-vectors and zpb-ttf, as an alternative
   to mcclim-freetype.
** Bug fix: correct computation of bounding rectangle after
   clear-output-record and recompute-extent-for-new-child.

* Changes in mcclim-0.9.5 relative to 0.9.4:
** Installation: the systems clim-listener, clim-examples,
   and clouseau can now be loaded without loading the system mcclim
   first. Users with existing McCLIM installations should use the 
   provided script:
   		./symlink-asd-files.sh /path/to/asdf-central-registry/
** New extension: tab-layout. This extension allows keeping a stack of panes 
   whose foreground pane is controlled by a tab bar. This layout can be 
   customized in backends and frame managers. For examples, see the
   gtkairo backend and the pixie frame manager.
** New extension function: SHEET-RGB-IMAGE: makes a screenshot of a sheet 
   in the CLX backend. (Supported on truecolor visuals only for now.)
** New experimental extension: tree-with-cross-edges are an extension to
   the graph formatter.
** New experimental backend: clim-graphic-forms: native widgets on Windows. 
   This backend is still very experimental (it doesn't run demos yet).
** New inspector feature: The inspector now displays more useful information
   about hash tables and generic functions.
** Specification compliance: Various layout panes no longer quite as
   aggressive at eating the space requirements of their children.
** Specification compliance: There is now a rudimentary implementation of 
   NOTIFY-USER
** Usability: Text editors and text input panes now use click-to-focus.
** Improvement: the ACCEPTING-VALUES command table was renamed to 
   ACCEPT-VALUES (as this is the name that the other clim-2 implementation 
   uses)
** Improvement: the CLX backend should no longer cause focus stealing
   when an application has text-editor panes.  This change comes with
   a rudimentary click-to-focus-keyboard widget policy.
** Improvement: define-application-frame now allows a :default-initargs
   option. (This is not exactly a "specification compliance" fix, as 
   d-a-frame is not defined to accept this option.).
** Improvement: menu-choose menus now look a little prettier.
** Improvement: added more styles for bordered-output: :rounded, :ellipse
** Improvement: Toggle button values now default to NIL.
** Improvement: Frame layouts are now inherited from the frame's 
   superclass.
** Improvement: The Lisp Syntax is much improved: now recognizes 
   delimiter characters, and more types of Lambda lists.
** Bug fix: Bezier designs should now draw in the right place in all 
   backends.
** Bug fix: Text in Drei no longer "walks" to the left.
** Bug fix: Drei now has better support for delimiter gestures.
** Bug fix: Partial commands now work better when invoked from the menu.


* Changes in mcclim-0.9.4 relative to 0.9.3:
** cleanup: removed the obsolete system.lisp file.
** backend improvements: Gtkairo
*** Double buffering is now supported (fixes disappearing widgets on Windows).
*** X errors no longer terminate the lisp process.
*** Some bugfixes, including CMUCL support and better key event handling.
*** Native implementation of context menus, list panes, label panes, and
    option panes.
*** Draw text using Pango.  (Bug fix: Fixed-width font supported on Windows
    now.  Multiple lines of output in TEXT-SIZE supported now.
    TEXT-STYLE-FIXED-WIDTH-P works correctly now.)
** Improvement: Added new editor substrate ("Drei").
** Improvement: Improved the pathname presentation methods considerably.
** specification compliance: DELETE-GESTURE-NAME function now implemented.
** specification compliance: PRESENTATION-TYPE-SPECIFIER-P presentaion
   function now implemented.
** specification compliance: DISPLAY-COMMAND-TABLE-MENU function now
   implemented.
** specification compliance: DISPLAY-COMMAND-MENU function now
   implemented.
** specification compliance: POINTER-PLACE-RUBBER-BAND-LINE* function
   now implemented.
** specification compliance: POINTER-INPUT-RECTANGLE* function now
   implemented.
** specification compliance: POINTER-INPUT-RECTANGLE function now
   implemented.
** Improvement: Added font listing support, see section "Fonts and Extended
   Text Styles" in the manual.
** Improvement: Added support for bezier splines (Robert Strandh).
   To be documented.
** better PRESENTATION-SUBTYPEP (more likely to give the right answer
   on some-of and all-of presentation types)
** Improvement: M-n/M-p gestures for navigating presentation histories.

* Changes in mcclim-0.9.3 "All Souls' Day" relative to 0.9.2:
** backend improvement: The Null backend now registers itself in the
   server search path
** improvement: with-output-as-gadget now sets the correct cursor
   position when incremental redisplay is active.
** specification compliance: INVOKE-WITH-NEW-OUTPUT-RECORD's argument
   list now is the same as the one in the Franz CLIM user guide.
** improvement: The text field cursor is now a solid block again.
** backend improvement: the PostScript backend now outputs correct EPS
** improvement: Graph nodes can now be dragged
** improvement: Possibilities when reading from
   COMPLETE-FROM-GENERATOR are now sorted alphabetically.
** new experimental backend: gtkairo (loads on SBCL, CMUCL and SCL):
   Uses GTK+ for gadgets and cairo for rendering graphics.
** Bug fix: incremental-redisplay does no longer leak memory
** improvement: incremental-redisplay is now a little faster
** Bug fix: Invisible text cursors no longer leave a dangling space
   behind the text output record
** improvement: commands whose names are shadowed in child command
   tables are now suggested in preference to their parents.
** Bug fix: (setf stream-cursor-position) and output record replay on
   encapsulating streams work now.
** Bug fix: Invoking command menu items in frames with no interactor
   works now.
** Bug fix: DESTROY-PORT removes the port even if an error occurs
   while closing the port
** Bug fix: make-process now sets the process name on SBCL
** specification compliance: MENU-CHOOSE now supports almost all
   features demanded in the CLIM 2.0 specification.
** improvement: new and improved ACCEPT presentation method for
   expressions on interactive streams.
** specification compliance: LOOKUP-KEYSTROKE-ITEM no longer accepts
   the :errorp argument.
** Bug fix: incremental redisplay no longer breaks on output records
   that had no children.
** Bug fix: arrow head sizes are now transformed along with the line thickness.
** improvement: resizing a viewport's child will now move the viewport's focus.
** improvement: loading mcclim.asd no longer shows a code deletion note on SBCL.
** new demo: logic-cube
** compatibility: Add support for post-1.0 openmcl, and for Allegro
   Common Lisp 8.0 (ansi mode).
** new example application showing use of CLIM views.
