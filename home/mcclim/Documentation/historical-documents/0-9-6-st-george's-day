RELEASE NOTES FOR McCLIM 0.9.6, "St. George's Day":

Compatibility
=============

This release was tested and found to work on the following
implementations:

 * SBCL
 * CMUCL 19d
 * Clozure CL 1.2 (RC 1)
 * CLISP 2.41 (requires "Telent" CLX)
 * Allegro Common Lisp 8.1 in ANSI Mode

McCLIM currently does not support lisps with case-sensitive
readers (Allegro CL "modern mode" and lower-case Scieneer CL).

To run McCLIM on Mac OS X 10.5, it is currently necessary to pass
an explicit DISPLAY argument to work around incompatibility between
Leopard's X11 auto-start facility and CLX.


Changes in mcclim-0.9.6 "St. George's Day" relative to 0.9.5:
==============================================================

From the NEWS file:
* New extension: mcclim-truetype: provides a 100% lisp path for 
  AA fonts with CLX using cl-vectors and zpb-ttf, as an alternative
  to mcclim-freetype.
* Improvement: Faster drawing and AA text rendering. AA text requires
  a fix to the Xrender support of CLX, available in Christophe Rhodes's
  current CLX distribution from darcs.
* Improvement: Look up arbitrary truetype fonts by name via fontconfig.
* Drei improvements
** New redisplay engine that is faster and has more features.
** Support for "views" concept.
** Support for modes a la Emacs "mini-modes".
** Improvement: Goal-columns for line movement.
** Improvement: More Emacs-like expression movement for Lisp syntax.
** Bug fix: Input prompting now works for directly recursive calls to
   ACCEPT.
* Specification compliance: READ-BITMAP-FILE and
  MAKE-PATTERN-FROM-BITMAP-FILE from CLIM 2.2. Includes new example
  program, IMAGE-VIEWER.
* Specification compliance: The :inherit-menu keyword argument to
  DEFINE-COMMAND-TABLE and MAKE-COMMAND-TABLE is now implemented with
  CLIM 2.2 semantics. The :keystrokes value is not handled yet.
* Specification compliance: :PRINTER functions for MENU-CHOOSE are
  now called with the menu item, not the display object.
* Bug fix: ESA's help commands are better at finding bindings and
  describing them
* Bug fix: Some missing methods and functions have been implemented
  for the Null backend, allowing headless operation for many
  applications.
* Bug fix: correct computation of bounding rectangle after
   clear-output-record and recompute-extent-for-new-child.
* Bug fix: label panes no longer have a restrictive maximum width.
* Bug fix: ellipses with a zero radius no longer cause errors.
* Bug fix: bezier drawing in CLIM-FIG less likely to cause errors.
* Bug fix: restored somewhat working undo in CLIM-FIG.
