RELEASE NOTES FOR McCLIM 0.9.3, "All Souls' Day":

Compatibility
=============

This release was tested and found to work on the following
implementations:

 * SBCL
 * OpenMCL
 * Allegro Common Lisp 8.0 in ANSI Mode
 * The Scieneer Common Lisp in ANSI Mode

In our tests, this release of McCLIM did not work on the following
implementations:

 * CLISP (there are some problems with CLISP at the moment, but it is
   possible to run McCLIM there; a HOWTO will be posted to
   http://planet.lisp.org).
 * CMUCL (at the time of this release, the released CMUCL has a bug
   that prevents successful loading of McCLIM; CMUCL 19d + patch 1 and
   the 2006-12 snapshot or later contain a fix for this problem)
 * LispWorks (no known workaround)

Also, McCLIM currently does not support lisps with case-sensitive
readers (ACL "modern mode" and lower-case SCL).

Changes in mcclim-0.9.3 "All Souls' Day" relative to 0.9.2:
===========================================================

From the NEWS file:

 * backend improvement: The Null backend now registers itself in the
   server search path
 * improvement: with-output-as-gadget now sets the correct cursor
   position when incremental redisplay is active.

   list now is the same as the one in the Franz CLIM user guide.
 * improvement: The text field cursor is now a solid block again.
 * backend improvement: the PostScript backend now outputs correct EPS
 * improvement: Graph nodes can now be dragged
 * improvement: Possibilities when reading from
   COMPLETE-FROM-GENERATOR are now sorted alphabetically.
 * new experimental backend: gtkairo (loads on SBCL, CMUCL and SCL):
   Uses GTK+ for gadgets and cairo for rendering graphics.
 * Bug fix: incremental-redisplay does no longer leak memory
 * improvement: incremental-redisplay is now a little faster
 * Bug fix: Invisible text cursors no longer leave a dangling space
   behind the text output record

   encapsulating streams work now.
