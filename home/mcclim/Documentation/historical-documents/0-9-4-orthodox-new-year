RELEASE NOTES FOR McCLIM 0.9.4, "Orthodox New Year":

Compatibility
=============

This release was tested and found to work on the following
implementations:

 * SBCL
 * OpenMCL
 * CLISP
 * Allegro Common Lisp 8.0 in ANSI Mode

In our tests, this release of McCLIM did not work on the following
implementations:

 * CMUCL (at the time of this release, the released CMUCL has a bug
   that prevents successful loading of McCLIM; CMUCL 19d + patch 1 and
   the 2006-12 snapshot or later contain a fix for this problem)

Also, McCLIM currently does not support lisps with case-sensitive
readers (ACL "modern mode" and lower-case SCL).

Known Bugs
==========

Due to the radical changes introduced by the new editor substrate,
some bugs may surface in day-to-day use. We would very much like to
hear about them on mcclim-devel@common-lisp.net. As a work-around, you
can enable the old input substrate by using
	(setf climi::*use-goatee* t)
on the REPL when clim is loaded.

The following bugs are known to exist:

* McCLIM freetype can interact poorly with Drei under some
  circumstances
* Drei does not handle most reader macros well
* Sometimes, the ENTER key is not very responsive when editing forms
  with Drei
* Calling stream-input-buffer is still buggy.
