@deffn {Macro} {@symbol{with-output-to-output-record,clim}} (stream &optional record-type record &rest initargs) &body body
Creates a new output record of type RECORD-TYPE and then captures
the output of BODY into the new output record. The cursor position of
STREAM is initially bound to (0,0)
    If RECORD is supplied, it is the name of a variable that will be
lexically bound to the new output record inside the body. INITARGS are
CLOS initargs that are passed to MAKE-INSTANCE when the new output
record is created.
    It returns the created output record.
    The STREAM argument is a symbol that is bound to an output
recording stream. If it is @code{t}, *STANDARD-OUTPUT* is used.
