@deffn {Generic Function} {@symbol{inspect-object-using-state,clouseau}} object state style stream
Present @var{object} to @var{stream} according to @var{state} and
@var{style}.

@var{state} stores information that is permanently associated with
@var{object}.

@var{style} on the other hand consists of transient information such as
whether @var{object} should be presented in expanded or collapsed form.

@var{stream} is the stream to which @var{object} should be presented.

Example:

@lisp
(defmethod clouseau:inspect-object-using-state
    ((object symbol)
     (state  clouseau:inspected-object)
     (style  (eql :expanded-body))
     (stream t))
  (clouseau:formatting-place
      (object 'clouseau:reader-place 'symbol-name
       present-place present-object)
    (write-string "Symbol name" stream)
    (present-place stream)
    (present-object stream)))
