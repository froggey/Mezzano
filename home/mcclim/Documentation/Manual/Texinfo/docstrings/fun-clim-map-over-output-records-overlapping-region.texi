@deffn {Generic Function} {@symbol{map-over-output-records-overlapping-region,clim}} function record region &optional x-offset y-offset &rest function-args
Maps over all of the children of the RECORD that
overlap the @code{region}, calling FUNCTION on each one. FUNCTION is a
function of one or more arguments, the first argument being the record
overlapping the region. FUNCTION is also called with all of
FUNCTION-ARGS as APPLY arguments.

If there are multiple records that overlap the region and that overlap
each other, @code{map-over-output-records-overlapping-region} hits the least
recently inserted record first and the most recently inserted record
last. Otherwise, the order in which the records are traversed is
unspecified.
