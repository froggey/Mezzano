@anchor{Function clouseau:inspect}
@deffn {Function} {@symbol{inspect,clouseau}} object &key new-process
Inspect @var{object} in a new inspector window.

Return two values: 1) @var{object} 2) the created inspector application
frame.

If @var{new-process} is false (the default), this function returns to
the caller after the inspector window has been closed. If
@var{new-process} is true, this function returns to the caller
immediately and the inspector frame executes in a separate thread.

@var{handle-errors} controls whether errors signaled when printing and
inspecting objects should be handled. @var{handle-errors} must be a
valid type specifier (@code{t} and @code{nil} are legal
values). Signaled errors of the specified type will be handled by
printing an error messages in place of the inspected object. Other
errors will not be handled and might invoke the debugger in the usual
way.
