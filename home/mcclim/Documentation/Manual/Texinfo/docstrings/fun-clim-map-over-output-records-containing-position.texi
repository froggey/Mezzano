@deffn {Generic Function} {@symbol{map-over-output-records-containing-position,clim}} function record x y &optional x-offset y-offset &rest function-args
Maps over all of the children of RECORD that
contain the point at (X,Y), calling FUNCTION on each one. FUNCTION is
a function of one or more arguments, the first argument being the
record containing the point. FUNCTION is also called with all of
FUNCTION-ARGS as APPLY arguments.

If there are multiple records that contain the point,
MAP-OVER-OUTPUT-RECORDS-CONTAINING-POSITION hits the most recently
inserted record first and the least recently inserted record
last. Otherwise, the order in which the records are traversed is
unspecified.
