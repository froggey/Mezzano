\section{Purpose}

\sysname{} is a library that that helps the programmer write
applications with a look and feel that resembles that of Emacs
(\cite{GNUEmacsLispReferenceManual,CraftOfTextEditiing,Finseth:1980:TPTa}).

\sysname{} supplies a command processor that is different from the one
supplied by standard \clim{}, making it practical to use multi-keystroke
command invocation, and invocation of commands with no keyboard
binding possible through \texttt{M-x}.

\sysname{} assumes that an application that displays a certain number
of buffers in a certain number of windows, and that at all times,
there is a current buffer that is being worked on.
