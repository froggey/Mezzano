reusing the original authors' work.

Hello!

I hope I got the correct "Ramona Rao", that is, the one that has
co-authored "A Guided Tour of CLIM". McCLIM is an effort to provide a
free CLIM environment for recent CL implementations like SBCL, CMUCL,
et al. The community hasn't come up with a useful and short
documentation like your tour to introduce users to
CLIM. Unfortunately, CLIM has changed and the examples included in the
article don't run anymore.

I would like to update this article to produce a tutorial for the McCLIM
community. Given the age of the article I presume that the interest in
commercial exploitation has also faded. Therefore, I would like to ask,
if it's possible to obtain any TeX source for this article. If the
source got lost, I could also extract the text and reformat it. Of
course, I would need your permission for these actions. Also, I'm not
sure if that's ok for ACM. Is any of that possible?

Thanks in advance!

P.S.: I found your article here http://lemonodor.com/archives/000765.html

Hello Mr. Doughty,

Together with Ramana Rao and Bill York, you have authored the article "A
guided tour of CLIM" for ACM in 1991. CLIM has changed much since 1991,
especially with the release of the CLIM 2 specification.

The CLIM community lacks a good and short introduction to CLIM like your
article was. I would like to update the examples in your article and
also rewrite parts of the article that doesn't apply to the new
CLIM. Assuming your permission for this action, I intend to publish this
update on my webpage to aid the CLIM community.

Ramano Rao as well as Bill York give me permission for this update. ACM
also acknowledged this step. Now, I would like to ask, if this is ok
with you.

Thank you,
Clemens

P.S. Here are the mails from Ramana Rao, ACM and Bill York:

Clemens,
Unfortunately, I don't seem to be able to get my hands on the original
tex source for that article.  I happily give you permission to adapt the
text as supports the CLIM community.  I've really been out of touch and
would be curious to hear any highlights of what's happening there.

Meanwhile, Bill York may be able to put his hands on the tex source.

Thanks,
Ramana

Dear Mr. Fruhwirth,

Thank you for your inquiry, and interest in ACM publications.

Because the article in question appeared in a SIG newsletter, rather than a
journal or conference proceedings, the authors retained copyright. In
this case, ACM only requires acknowledgment of the original publication.

You have received permission from two of the three authors, but you
should also pursue the third author's permission, especially since you
have revised the original work.

Let me know if you have any further questions.

Best regards,

Deborah Cotton

Hi Robert,

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.  I'm no longer
at Pantero and it's only a coincidence that I ended up seeing
this email.

Absolutely you may have my permission to update the article.
