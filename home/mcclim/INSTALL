Prerequisites:
==============

ASDF - The ASDF system definition facility. Many implementations come
with it and (require :asdf) is all that is needed. If yours doesn't,
see http://www.cliki.net/asdf.



Installing McCLIM using mcclim.asd
==================================

To tell ASDF about the wherabouts of McCLIM and to compile it for the
first time, perform these steps:

 1. Symlink mcclim.asd to a directory in your
    asdf:*central-registry* list. E.g., for SBCL, that would be:

      $ ln -sf /path/to/mcclim.asd ~/.sbcl/systems/

 2. If you are using a Lisp implementation that requires a separate
    CLX to be installed, do this now and symlink the clx's .asd file
    to your asdf:*central-registry*, as above. If your
    implementation's CLX doesn't come with a clx.asd file, you will
    have to load CLX via (require :clx) or a similar mechanism
    yourself.

 3. You need to install the spatial-trees library (available at
    http://cliki.net/spatial-trees). The preferred method for that is
    via asdf-install. see http://cliki.net/asdf-install for an
    introduction to that method.
    
 4. On your Lisp's REPL (with ASDF loaded), type

     (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :mcclim)
     ; compilation messages should zip past

After step 4, McCLIM and the CLX backend should be loaded and
you are good to go.

When you restart your lisp image, you will need to perform step 4 to
load McCLIM again.

Installing mcclim.asd if you were using ASDF & system.lisp before
=================================================================

Make sure to remove all symlinks in your asdf:*central-registry* to
system.lisp and replace them with symlinks to mcclim.asd. Keeping the
old links around will break loading the McCLIM system in subtle ways.

After replacing the symlinks, follow the "Installing McCLIM..."
section above, beginning at step 1 - the symlink mcclim.asd itself is
required, too.

Writing a system that depends on McCLIM
=======================================

In an ASDF system that depends on a loaded CLIM, use the following
code to declare a dependency on McCLIM:

(defsystem :your-clim-using-system
           :depends-on (:mcclim #| other dependencies |#)
           :components (#| components |#)
           )

The dependency on the McCLIM system will also load a suitable display
backend on implementations where it can determine one.

Running the demos
=================

McCLIM comes with some interesting demo programs and applications:
    address-book - The classic CLIM demo:        (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :clim-examples)    (in-package :clim-demo)    (run-frame-top-level (make-application-frame 'address-book))     The Examples directory includes other demo programs that might be    of interest. Many of these are quite old and were written before    large parts of the CLIM specification were implemented; for good
   examples of CLIM style it is best to look elsewhere.


   clim-listener - a Lisp 'listener' or top-level loop with many
   goodies for examining directories, CLOS classes, etc. Printed
   results are mouse-sensitive and in supported implementations    (currently OpenMCL) can be used directly as arguments in Lisp expressions:     (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :clim-listener)    (clim-listener:run-listener)         functional-geometry - Frank Buss' and Rainer Joswig's functional
   geometry explorer, implemented on top of clim-listener:     (load "Apps/Functional-Geometry/functional-geometry.asd")    (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :functional-geometry)    (functional-geometry::run-functional-geometry)   Installation Notes for Implementations
======================================

Notes about bugs or gotchas in specific Common Lisp implementations
appear in the release notes found in the ReleaseNotes directory.

Franz Allegro Common Lisp
=========================

McCLIM has been tested with the ANSI Common Lisp image alisp. It
doesn't currently work in with "modern Lisp" but support is on the way.


OpenMCL
=======

McCLIM has been tested with openmcl-1.0. It is recommended that you
download CLX from ftp://clozure.com/pub/CLX.


CLISP
=====

1. Get clisp-20041218 or newer. Build it with option --with-module=clx/mit-clx.

2. Get a copy of the ASDF package. Compile it:
     $ clisp -c $ASDF/asdf.lisp

3. Start
     $ clisp -K full -i $ASDF/asdf.fas

and continue as above.


CMUCL
=====

McCLIM has been tested with version 19.c.

SBCL
====

McCLIM has been tested with version 0.9.8 and later.
