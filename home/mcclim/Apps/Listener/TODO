There are plenty of things left to do before the listener will really be useful
for its intended purpose:

McCLIM TODO:
 - Implement more of the emacs editing keys
 - Completion of pathnames and symbols
 - Subform accepting in places other than OpenMCL
 - Error checking during form reading

Listener TODO:
 - Cleanup of mime type representation (no point in defining classes for each
   mime type, just define classes for the media types, and use EQL specializers
   to distinguish between subtypes in methods.
 - Flesh out icons - support multiple sizes in separate subdirectories of icons/
 - Implement sorting and other options to Show Directory
 - Copy File, Delete File, etc.
 - Debugger integration
