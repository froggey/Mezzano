* Introduction

  The ~clouseau~ system provides a CLIM-based graphical inspector ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspector_Clouseau][get
  it?]]) for Common Lisp objects. It can be used as a standalone
  application or embedded into CLIM applications.

* Quick Start

  Start your Lisp system (the ~clouseau~ system should be portable,
  but only SBCL and CCL have been tested) and load the system:

  #+BEGIN_SRC lisp :exports both :results silent
    (asdf:load-system "clouseau")
  #+END_SRC

  Then inspect an object:

  #+BEGIN_SRC lisp :exports code
    (clouseau:inspect
     (make-array 4 :adjustable t
                   :fill-pointer 3
                   :initial-contents (list 1.5d0 #'numberp
                                           (list (cons #\a "foo")
                                                 (cons :bar #P"baz"))
                                           (alexandria:alist-hash-table
                                            (list (cons #C(1 2)
                                                        (find-class 'class)))))))
  #+END_SRC

  A window containing the following should open (in the screenshot,
  the array elements have been expanded by left-clicking them):

  [[file:../../Documentation/Manual/Texinfo/figures/clouseau-startup-screenshot.png]]

  + Left-click an object to expand or collapse it.

  + Middle-click an object to make it the new root (as in the SLIME
    inspector).

  + Right-click an object to open a context menu containing other
    commands applicable to the object.

* Documentation

  + For user and developer documentation see the Inspector chapter in
    file:../../Documentation/Manual/Texinfo/.

  + For design-related documentation that may be useful when working
    on the inspector clouseau system itself, see [[file:DESIGN.org]].
