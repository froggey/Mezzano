;;; Technology.
;;;
;;; The LOOP iteration macro is one of a number of pieces of code
;;; originally developed at MIT for which free distribution has been
;;; permitted, as long as the code is not sold for profit, and as long
;;; as notification of MIT's interest in the code is preserved.
;;;
;;; This version of LOOP, which is almost entirely rewritten both as
;;; clean-up and to conform with the ANSI Lisp LOOP standard, started
;;; life as MIT LOOP version 829 (which was a part of NIL, possibly
;;; never released).
;;;
;;; A "light revision" was performed by me (Glenn Burke) while at
;;; Palladian Software in April 1986, to make the code run in Common
;;; Lisp.  This revision was informally distributed to a number of
;;; people, and was sort of the "MIT" version of LOOP for running in
;;; Common Lisp.
;;;
;;; A later more drastic revision was performed at Palladian perhaps a
;;; year later.  This version was more thoroughly Common Lisp in style,
;;; with a few miscellaneous internal improvements and extensions.  I
;;; have lost track of this source, apparently never having moved it to
;;; the MIT distribution point.  I do not remember if it was ever
;;; distributed.
;;;
;;; This revision for the ANSI standard is based on the code of my April
;;; 1986 version, with almost everything redesigned and/or rewritten.


;;; The design of this LOOP is intended to permit, using mostly the same
;;; kernel of code, up to three different "loop" macros:
;;;
;;; (1) The unextended, unextensible ANSI standard LOOP;
;;;
;;; (2) A clean "superset" extension of the ANSI LOOP which provides
;;; functionality similar to that of the old LOOP, but "in the style of"
;;; the ANSI LOOP.  For instance, user-definable iteration paths, with a
;;; somewhat cleaned-up interface.
;;;
;;; (3) Extensions provided in another file which can make this LOOP
;;; kernel behave largely compatibly with the Genera-vintage LOOP macro,
;;; with only a small addition of code (instead of two whole, separate,
;;; LOOP macros).
;;;
;;; Each of the above three LOOP variations can coexist in the same LISP
;;; environment.
;;;


;;;; Miscellaneous Environment Things



;;;@@@@The LOOP-Prefer-POP feature makes LOOP generate code which "prefers" to use POP or
;;; its obvious expansion (prog1 (car x) (setq x (cdr x))).  Usually this involves
;;; shifting fenceposts in an iteration or series of carcdr operations.  This is
;;; primarily recognized in the list iterators (FOR .. {IN,ON}), and LOOP's
;;; destructuring setq code.

;;; The uses of this macro are retained in the CL version of loop, in
;;; case they are needed in a particular implementation.  Originally
;;; dating from the use of the Zetalisp COPYLIST* function, this is used
;;; in situations where, were cdr-coding in use, having cdr-NIL at the
;;; end of the list might be suboptimal because the end of the list will
;;; probably be RPLACDed and so cdr-normal should be used instead.

;;;; Maximization Technology


#|
The basic idea of all this minimax randomness here is that we have to
have constructed all uses of maximize and minimize to a particular
"destination" before we can decide how to code them.  The goal is to not
have to have any kinds of flags, by knowing both that (1) the type is
something which we can provide an initial minimum or maximum value for
and (2) know that a MAXIMIZE and MINIMIZE are not being combined.

SO, we have a datastructure which we annotate with all sorts of things,
incrementally updating it as we generate loop body code, and then use
a wrapper and internal macros to do the coding when the loop has been
constructed.

;;;; Loop Keyword Tables


#|
LOOP keyword tables are hash tables string keys and a test of EQUAL.

The actual descriptive/dispatch structure used by LOOP is called a "loop
universe" contains a few tables and parameterizations.  The basic idea is
that we can provide a non-extensible ANSI-compatible loop environment,
an extensible ANSI-superset loop environment, and (for such environments
as CLOE) one which is "sufficiently close" to the old Genera-vintage
LOOP for use by old user programs without requiring all of the old LOOP
code to be loaded.
