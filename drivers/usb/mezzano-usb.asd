;; The USB driver has three layers: the middle layer, the USB Driver
;; (USBD) layer, contains the code that is common across host
;; controllers and devices; the bottom layer, the Hardware Abstraction
;; Layer (HAL) or Host Controller Driver (HCD) layer, contains code
;; that is specific to a host controller; and, the top layer consists
;; of drivers for specific devices or classes of devices.

;; The middle layer consists of services such as buffers and worker
;; threads and code that only depends on the USB specs. In addition,
;; it defines the interfaces that are provided by the bottom layer and
;; used by the top layer. In order to prevent the middle layer from
;; being a collection of pass through functions, serveral classes are
;; defined which are used as super classes by the bottom layer
;; classes. This allows the middle layer to provide common
;; functionality with lower overhead. The middle layer is defined by
;; the "mezzano-usb" system.

;; The bottom layer consists of drivers for each of the supported host
;; controlles. Curently (Aug. 12, 2019) only the Open Host Controller
;; Interface (OHCI) controller is supported. OHCI only supports USB
;; 1.1. Drivers for additional host controllers should be added over
;; time. In particular, there should be a driver for the Enhanced Host
;; Controller Interface (EHCI) which supports USB 2.0 and the
;; eXtensible Host Controller Interface (xHCI) which supports USB 3.

;; The top layer consists of vendor specific device drivers and class
;; device drivers. For example, logitech.lisp contains a hand coded
;; device specific driver for the Logitech Trackman Wheel pointing
;; device (mouse). It is not included in the system because that mouse,
;; along with several other mice, are handled by the Human Interface
;; Device (HID) driver. The HID driver is a class driver that (should)
;; handle all HIDs. Currently (Aug. 12, 2019), the HID driver only
;; supports mice.

;; Debug support is provided in separate files and consists mostly of
;; functions that print various data structures in human readable
;; format.
