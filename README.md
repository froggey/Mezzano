# Mezzano, an operating system written in Common Lisp.

`C-<key>` means to hold the control key while typing `<key>`.

`M-<key>` means to hold the alt or meta key while typing `<key>`.

Alphabetic keys typed with control or meta ignore case. `C-A` and `C-a` are the same key, while `C-!` and `C-1` are different.

The default keymap is En-GB, use M-F12 to switch between En-GB, En-US, No-BK, PanCyr, German, and ES-ESP keymaps.
Windows can be moved by dragging their titlebar or by holding the Alt key and dragging.

For help & support, join #mezzano on Freenode (irc.freenode.net)

`M-Esc` will attempt to interrupt the thread associated with the current window.
This won't work if the thread is stuck in a tight loop or if the thread is blocked.

# Line editing

The line editor supports most standard line navigation and editing commands.

`C-F`          Move forward (right) one character, also bound to Right-Arrow.

`C-B`          Move backward (left) one character, also bound to Left-Arrow.

`C-A`          Move to beginning of line, also bound to Home.

`C-E`          Move to end of line, also bound to End.

`M-F`          Move forward one word.

`M-B`          Move backward one word.

`M-P`          Find previous (older) matching history item, also bound to Up-Arrow.

`M-N`          Find next (newer) matching history item, also bound to Down-Arrow.

# Editor commands

`M-Backspace`  Kill the previous word.

`C-K`          Kill characters from the point to the end of the line, or kill

the newline if the point is at the end of the line.

`C-M-K`        Kill the next s-expression forward.

`C-W`          Kill the area between the point and the mark.

`C-X C-X`      Swap the point and the mark.

`C-X C-F`      Open or create a file.

`C-X C-S`      Save the current buffer. If the buffer has no path, you will be prompted for a location to save it.

`C-X C-W`      Save the current buffer with a new path.

`C-X b`        Switch to a different buffer.

`C-X C-B`      List buffers.

`C-X k`        Close an open buffer.

`C-G`          Abort the current command.

`C-C C-C`      Evaluate the current top-level form.

`C-C C-A`      Move to the start of the current top-level form.

`M-x repl`     Create an editor-based REPL.

# Swank

This release includes Swank 2016-03-04.
The Swank server is listening on port 4005.

Forwarding for port 4005 will need to be enabled in the virtual
machine's settings. In VirtualBox this is done through the port
forwarding settings, which can be accessed through
Settings -> Network -> Advanced -> Port Forwarding

# Major changes since Demo 2
Trentino, a media player, has been implemented by Eugene Zaikonnikov.
Further improvements to conformance, stability and performance.
The CLOS implementation follows the MOP much more closely.
More traditional window management.
Booting from CD/USB on real hardware is now possible.
Driver support for Intel HDA audio devices.
VirtualBox guest (mouse & display) integration.

# Major changes since Demo 1

Many improvements to conformance, stability and performance.
The editor has been greatly improved, thanks to Burton Samograd.
The system now functions correctly on computers with more than 1GB of RAM.
The allocator and garbage collector now make much better use of available
memory, with far fewer GC cycles occurring.
(ROOM T) prints more detailed information about allocated objects.
Transparency and premultiplied alpha support in the GUI.
And more!

# Whole-system transparent persistence support

Run `(mezzano.supervisor:snapshot)` in a REPL.
Wait for the yellow light to turn off.
Reboot.

This will take a snapshot of the current machine state, saving it to disk.
It will be restored when the machine is booted.
